Remeliik, was dressed in a T-shirt and shorts as he drove home on the night of his assassination. It was just after midnight, June 30, 1985. He pulled up the driveway, parking near a hill dense with tapioca and taro plants. Seconds after he climbed from the driver's seat, a shot rang out from what was described as a .30-caliber assault rifle. President Remeliik tumbled down the slope as four rounds were pumped into his head, neck and left thigh. Word spreads quickly in a place so small that neighbors are often cousins, and within hours the 14,000 people of Palau, an American-administered trust territory southeast of the Philippines, learned that their first elected President had been assassinated.","['REMELIIK, HARUO', 'SABINO, ANGHENIO', 'RICHENTHAL, DAVID G', 'TMETUCHI, MELWERT', 'BECK, STUART J', 'TEWID, LESLIE', 'PALAU', 'FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION', 'AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION', 'ASSASSINATIONS AND ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATIONS']",http://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/27/world/doubts-cling-to-pacific-assassination-verdict.html
