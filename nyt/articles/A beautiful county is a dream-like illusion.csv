2001-08-19T00:00:00Z,"A few months ago I visited an AIDS organization called the Freedom Foundation outside Bangalore in South India. The whitewashed buildings, once part of a chicken farm, had been converted into a haven for people with H.I.V. infection. By scrambling and cajoling, the volunteer staff managed to get antiretroviral drugs for every infected child. But for the adults wasting away from unchecked H.I.V. infection, the future did not look bright. Had they been able to afford the medications, or for that matter, been residents of the United States, patients in my county hospital in El Paso, Tex., I felt they soon would have had flesh on their bones, the strength to sit up and the prospect of a future. Patients and caregivers at the Freedom Foundation could only look to the horizon and hope that someday, in some research lab, a scientific breakthrough would result in a novel means of attacking H.I.V., something both effective and affordable. If this should happen -- whether vaccine or drug -- the odds are great that it will come from an American research lab. The United States has not only been at the forefront of AIDS research, it has also become the de facto biomedical research wing of our planet. All over the world parents of children with AIDS, with spinal-cord injuries and with so many other diseases dream of miracles that might change their children's future, and it is to the U.S. that they look. The quaint image of a researcher with a pith helmet and microscope working in a jungle is an illusion; the tough questions of basic science require sophisticated institutions and expensive tools of molecular biology -- and money.","['BUSH, GEORGE W', 'STEM CELLS', 'FETAL TISSUE', 'MEDICINE AND HEALTH', 'RESEARCH']",http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/19/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-cell-block.html

2000-12-03T00:00:00Z,"One gardening book after another this season explains the ancient uses of the word ''paradise,'' leading us back to the walled gardens of the Persians, to the Virgin's enclosed bower in medieval paintings, to the earthly roots of what has become a theological rather than a horticultural concept. But the definition of paradise, to my mind, depends as much on the kind of gardener to be found there as it does on the kind of garden. In Milton's version of Eden, Eve says to Adam, ''what we by day / Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, / One night or two with wanton growth derides, / Tending to wild.'' Gardens do by nature tend to wild, of course. But can paradise really require the meticulous labor so obvious in the images of enclosed Persian gardens and the Virgin's hortus conclusus? Surely paradise, if anywhere, is the place for the person Christopher Lloyd calls ''the inattentive gardener.'' The book that phrase comes from, CHRISTOPHER LLOYD'S GARDEN FLOWERS: Perennials, Bulbs, Grasses, Ferns (Timber Press, $39.95), is inhabited by many fictional gardeners, as well as by plants from acanthus -- which Milton says grew near Adam and Eve's retreat in Eden -- to zigadenus. Besides inattentive gardeners growing aquilegia, Lloyd mentions ''gardeners of the silver and gray, impeccable taste, school'' who decry cannas, and gardeners growing gauras, mostly, it seems -- who earn this slightly disdainful caution: ''Beware of harboring too many plants in your garden of which the adjectives graceful and charming perpetually spring to your besotted lips.'' When you have been God in your own small heaven, as Lloyd, now approaching 80, has been at Great Dixter, a 15th-century house in East Sussex, since he was born, you can write that way about the vanities that other gardeners and their plants tend to suffer. ''Beware,'' says Lloyd, and it sounds like a warning against the fruits of a certain tree.","['REVIEWS', 'BOOKS AND LITERATURE', 'GARDENS AND GARDENING']",http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/03/books/gardening-331465.html

But the definition of paradise, to my mind, depends as much on the kind of gardener to be found there as it does on the kind of garden. In Milton's version of Eden, Eve says to Adam, ''what we by day / Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, / One night or two with wanton growth derides, / Tending to wild.'' Gardens do by nature tend to wild, of course. But can paradise really require the meticulous labor so obvious in the images of enclosed Persian gardens and the Virgin's hortus conclusus? Surely paradise, if anywhere, is the place for the person Christopher Lloyd calls ''the inattentive gardener.'' The book that phrase comes from, CHRISTOPHER LLOYD'S GARDEN FLOWERS: Perennials, Bulbs, Grasses, Ferns (Timber Press, $39.95), is inhabited by many fictional gardeners, as well as by plants from acanthus -- which Milton says grew near Adam and Eve's retreat in Eden -- to zigadenus. Besides inattentive gardeners growing aquilegia, Lloyd mentions ''gardeners of the silver and gray, impeccable taste, school'' who decry cannas, and gardeners growing gauras, mostly, it seems -- who earn this slightly disdainful caution: ''Beware of harboring too many plants in your garden of which the adjectives graceful and charming perpetually spring to your besotted lips.'' When you have been God in your own small heaven, as Lloyd, now approaching 80, has been at Great Dixter, a 15th-century house in East Sussex, since he was born, you can write that way about the vanities that other gardeners and their plants tend to suffer.

In Milton's version of Eden, Eve says to Adam, ''what we by day / Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, / One night or two with wanton growth derides, / Tending to wild.'' Gardens do by nature tend to wild, of course. But can paradise really require the meticulous labor so obvious in the images of enclosed Persian gardens and the Virgin's hortus conclusus? Surely paradise, if anywhere, is the place for the person Christopher Lloyd calls ''the inattentive gardener.'' The book that phrase comes from, CHRISTOPHER LLOYD'S GARDEN FLOWERS: Perennials, Bulbs, Grasses, Ferns (Timber Press, $39.95), is inhabited by many fictional gardeners, as well as by plants from acanthus -- which Milton says grew near Adam and Eve's retreat in Eden -- to zigadenus. Besides inattentive gardeners growing aquilegia, Lloyd mentions ''gardeners of the silver and gray, impeccable taste, school'' who decry cannas, and gardeners growing gauras, mostly, it seems -- who earn this slightly disdainful caution: ''Beware of harboring too many plants in your garden of which the adjectives graceful and charming perpetually spring to your besotted lips.'' When you have been God in your own small heaven, as Lloyd, now approaching 80, has been at Great Dixter, a 15th-century house in East Sussex, since he was born, you can write that way about the vanities that other gardeners and their plants tend to suffer. ''Beware,'' says Lloyd, and it sounds like a warning against the fruits of a certain tree.","['REVIEWS', 'BOOKS AND LITERATURE', 'GARDENS AND GARDENING']",http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/03/books/gardening-331465.html

2001-08-19T00:00:00Z,"A few months ago I visited an AIDS organization called the Freedom Foundation outside Bangalore in South India. The whitewashed buildings, once part of a chicken farm, had been converted into a haven for people with H.I.V. infection. By scrambling and cajoling, the volunteer staff managed to get antiretroviral drugs for every infected child. But for the adults wasting away from unchecked H.I.V. infection, the future did not look bright. Had they been able to afford the medications, or for that matter, been residents of the United States, patients in my county hospital in El Paso, Tex., I felt they soon would have had flesh on their bones, the strength to sit up and the prospect of a future. Patients and caregivers at the Freedom Foundation could only look to the horizon and hope that someday, in some research lab, a scientific breakthrough would result in a novel means of attacking H.I.V., something both effective and affordable. If this should happen -- whether vaccine or drug -- the odds are great that it will come from an American research lab. The United States has not only been at the forefront of AIDS research, it has also become the de facto biomedical research wing of our planet. All over the world parents of children with AIDS, with spinal-cord injuries and with so many other diseases dream of miracles that might change their children's future, and it is to the U.S. that they look. The quaint image of a researcher with a pith helmet and microscope working in a jungle is an illusion; the tough questions of basic science require sophisticated institutions and expensive tools of molecular biology -- and money.","['BUSH, GEORGE W', 'STEM CELLS', 'FETAL TISSUE', 'MEDICINE AND HEALTH', 'RESEARCH']",http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/19/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-cell-block.html
