first four lectures taking place weekendand subject weekends talk five aggregates 1
relationship us thats simply want tobe happy dont want suffer 1
heard words songrecently said "i dont mind dying living scaresme 1
us know difficulties life trying somehowto minimize 1
buddha said true lifeis followed another life another another anotherthen problems multiplied 1
fortunately onlybad news buddha also found way escapingfrom suffering main reason 1
buddha found suffering derived amistake cognition actual antidote mistakeis cultivation certain wisdom wisdom knownas wisdom realizing selflessness teaching onselflessness mainly distinguishes buddhas philosophyfrom world philosophies 1
selflessness referring aquality things possess quality absence;it absence illusion mistakenly projected onall things 1
teachings buddha either directly orindirectly trying lead student discover thatabsence 1
teachings speaking directly thissubject fall category perfection wisdomscriptures scriptures find statements like"the five aggregates empty self" 1
task findout means first begin findingout five aggregates 1
general five aggregates way classifying bodyand mind 1
two main constituents make personare body mind 1
rather merely saying body andmind buddha mentioned five classifications wasteaching using handfuls grain say thisaggregate aggregate aggregate five alltogether 1
sanskrit word skanda means apile heap pile rice five theaggregate form feeling recognition compositional factorsand consciousness 1
first three mentioned particular oftheir relationship desire 1
addition mentioning thatthe source sufferings misknowledge realityat times buddha said source ourproblems desire 1
however know notreferring desire 1
instance desire happy isnot source problems 1
desire escape ones problems isalso source suffering 1
referring aspecific type desire desire whose objectappears source happiness fact 1
itis desire respect desire towards anhallucination means eliminating desire bydiscovering object hallucination 1
types objects negative desirearises towards? 1
well one bodies others 1
uncommon thata body appear exaggerated way causing seem ifit source happiness body also allthe objects senses 1
order discover actualityof objects senses buddha taught thebuddha mentioned aggregate form 1
desire arises things feel good 1
fact thedesire motivates people arises pleasantexperiences thought "this feels good thereforei want never parted 1
common thought! 1
wherethe mistake arises expression "never parted fromit" especially object something impermanent thatthere way contact preserved for- ever 1
consequently desire setting oneself disappointment 1
therefore order explore feelings buddha mentionedthe second aggregate aggregate feeling 1
another object people become attached desire areideas 1
disputes scholars get get heatedbecause scholars become attached ideas anddiscriminations regarding superior othersideas inferior causing desire idea berecognized supreme 1
fuels actions speech andso forth make various disputes one gets cancome extremes causing closed mindedness losing theability openly examine others ideas 1
order explore suchdiscriminations ideation buddha mentioned aggregate ofdiscriminations 1
many functions emotions mind heheaped classification known compositionalfactors 1
texts compositional factor aggregate iscalled volition volition one functions mindthat contained within class 1
example givingthe name member group whole group 1
volltionwas chosen rather others itsimportance desire instance onlybring experience put action way itis put action volition 1
instance one havethe desire possess something onegenerates actual get action follows andsuch volition known karma 1
word karmais used colloquially refer experiences occur topeople 1
technically experiences known results ofkarma technically karma referring action isthe cause experiences 1
karma referring tovolition well actions body speechmotivated set action inmotion youre bound result like turning awheel 1
something important analyze come toknow buddha mentioned aggregate compositionalfactors 1
last aggregate aggregate consciousness isreferring six consciousnesses visual auditoryolfactory gustatory tactile mental mainmeans come know various objects compose reality 1
also important investigate 1
brief presentation five aggregates 1
doctrine selflessness theres said two types 1
selflessness person selflessness phenomena andthe person said designated dependenceupon aggregates expression "i amsitting 1
person designated independence upon form aggregate beingdesignated dependence upon body included theform aggregate 1
without body wouldnt able thethought "i sitting 1
great indian master nagarjunawho elucidated buddhas teaching selflessness said thatthe misconception self person arises dependingupon misconception self phenomena 1
phenomenathere meant five aggregates example ofmistaking way five aggregates exist thebody mistaking way exists mistake theway exists dependent upon aggregates 1
bymistaking way exists one mistakes way others existand mistaking way others exist perverse thoughtsas clinging ill arise 1
due arisal suchemotional addictions comes volition acting ofthose emotions due action one bound experiencethe result creates cycle vicious circle death andrebirth 1
nagarjuna mentioned book precious garland ofadvice king 1
tried clarify themistake self person mistake self ofphenomena order generate wisdom selflessness ofperson phenomena order put end viciouscircle existence 1
studying book benefits order make senseof nagarjunas arguments appreciation ofthe world view held 1
instance nagarjuna wasdescribing phenomena terms four elements;earth water fire air 1
presentation beenemployed western education long time! 1
yourelooking elements look periodic table hasdozens elements requires certain love ofchemistry penetrate 1
presentation things terms offour elements seems simplistic comparison periodictable elegance understandit youll able understand arguments set forth inthe buddhist classics precious garland" 1
necessary read classics order gain thewisdom realizing selflessness 1
instance one byrelying words master correctunderstanding selflessness present contemporaryterms benefit able appreciate thepresentations classic texts texts arethe scriptural authorities masters relying uponfor generations thus understanding seethat understanding supported classic textsyoull much confidence understanding 1
itsalways nice know contemporary masters relyingupon get understanding 1
helps lot avoidcultism knowledge personal property ofanybody discover knowledge generatedby study timeless wisdom know thesole property one individual please orderto get drops 1
following far? 1
begin detailed presentation fiveaggregates 1
first form aggregate 1
consists ofeleven items 1
q: difference volition mentalconsciousness? 1
ill give quick answer later therell moredetails 1
mental consciousness included fifthaggregate volition included forth aggregate andvolition function find consciousnesses 1
mentalconsciousness function volition seemental consciousness something merely knowing itsobject whereas volition way mentalconsciousness relates object functions respect tothat object 1
information comes later 1
mentioned eleven divisions form saythat source im taking information isthe book meditation emptiness" professor jeffrey hopkins 1
youre frustrated able take notes asfast speaking youll find information thatbook 1
eye sense organ lets use word organ letsuse word power eye sense faculty eye power eyefaculty whatever choose 1
choose one rather allof takes long 1
eye faculty ear faculty nose faculty tongue faculty bodyfaculty 1
thats five far 1
theres visual form soundsmell taste tactile objects eleventh one form forthe mental consciousness 1
respect first five whats meant byfaculty? 1
well form made particles 1
sayatomically constructed 1
thats mean form thefaculty form enables consciousness accessto respective objects 1
example eye faculty enablesvisual consciousness function within field visual formor visual objects ear faculty allows auditoryconsciousness function within field sound 1
todistinguish eye faculty eye ball theeye faculty found 1
similarly ear faculty thefleshy ear forth 1
faculties composed ofparticles subtle subtle anybody seethem 1
whether seen machinery dont know 1
texts say clever persons certain types superknowledge see forms thus certain shapes beenattributed 1
eye faculty shaped like thebud 1
ear faculty shapedlike knot birch tree 1
im mentioning saythat faculties seen somebody thought thatthey could distinguished shapes 1
didnt stopwith mere designation name 1
nose faculty shapedlike two hollow needles root nose 1
tonguefaculty shaped like many half moons diameter tip ofa hair one diameter tip hair arefound middle tongue 1
body faculty shapedlike skin hide pervading body 1
faculties function enabling theirrespective consciousnesses access respective objects 1
five sense consciousnesses 1
somebody might remembered mentioned sixconsciousnesses consciousness aggregate 1
therefore someonemight wonder consciousness faculty? 1
thatmental consciousness faculty? 1
tohave enables access object 1
facultiesare necessary conditions arising consciousness andthe faculty known dominate condition givingthat consciousness power respect object causingthat consciousness operate one field rather thananother field 1
example due eye faculty visualconsciousness see visual objects cannot see sounds 1
mental consciousness also mental faculty functionsas dominate condition unlike five senseconsciousnesses mental faculty form 1
unlikethose five faculties ive mentioned form mentalfaculty composed particles 1
hope im going slow isso much information would better go home withsomething rather remembering blur sound 1
mental faculty previous moment consciousnesssuch visual consciousness enables mentalconsciousness access visual objects 1
therefore visualconsciousness would considered mental faculty dominatecondition arising mental consciousness perceivingvisual objects 1
kinds interesting things discuss arisefrom presentation isnt enough time okay case visual faculty thefunction enables consciousness access visual objects allkinds interesting things discuss arise apresentation isnt enough time 1
okay case visual faculty thefunction enables visual consciousness access visualobjects 1
visual forms objects ofvisual consciousness? 1
two main types: shapes andcolors: white blue red yellow; said thecolor four elements 1
air white water blue fire isred earth yellow 1
another presentation eightsecondary colors 1
bit bizarre though color ofcloud color smoke color mist color ofillumination color darkness color shadow thecolor sunlight 1
two lists divisions color obviously notexhaustive 1
color visual objects 1
areshapes different kinds long shapesshort shapes long board deep well 1
thereshigh low theres shape known square refer toany polygon 1
thats also example name part givento whole 1
although called square shaped referto shape dice also refer shape ofrectangular boxes forth 1
theres round shapewhich refer anything egg-shaped also refer theso called flat circle 1
theres level shape like shape ofthe surface floor 1
non level shapesuch shape ploughed field irregular 1
shapes colors visual conscious sees 1
questionarises see vase 1
course one would say "yes" technically speaking visual consciousness seeingis shape color vase vase ashape color 1
one come associate vasewith shape visual consciousness immediatelygive rise thought thinking vase 1
cognition thinkingvase employs word vase thus done aconceptual consciousness called "seeing vase simplybecause close relationship seeing colorand shape vase conception thinking vase thatarises result 1
example giving name cause theresult 1
cause visual consciousness resultbeing mental consciousness conception 1
soundsvery mechanical concrete 1
based upon thesautantrika view buddhist tenet 1
concreteview world 1
logical categorical 1
liketo keep categories straight without mixing allknow nothing clear 1
person interested inparticle physics quantum mechanics must first pass throughnewtonian physics get likewise useful usto see world sautantrika point view getinto bizarre explanations higher schools buddhistthought prasangika 1
quantum mechanics arosebecause explore view newton mechanicsyou discover extremely tiny things also vast distancesin words limits view someproblems 1
likewise explore limits sautantrikaview see need jump higher view 1
use exampleof physics knew something one myworst subjects actually 1
sound defined object auditory consciousness andtheres different ways dividing 1
one way sound arises elements conjoined withconsciousness sound arising elements conjoined withconsciousness 1
sound arises elements conjoined consciousnesswould sounds made human 1
amongst sounds made bya human theres two types articulate sounds nonarticulate sounds 1
articulate sounds sounds denote ameaning words articulate sounds theres two typespleasant unpleasant 1
pleasant articulate sound might begood poetry unpleasant articulate sound might criticism 1
non articulate sounds dont denote meaning inparticular two types; pleasant unpleasant 1
pleasant one might snapping fingers unpleasantone might sound hand slapping face 1
amongst sounds arising elements conjoined withconsciousness two types; articulate non articulate 1
definition one denotes meaning andthe doesnt 1
articulate two types pleasantand unpleasant 1
might pleasant one thats articulatesound? 1
theres legendary dharma drum heavens 1
thebeating produces dharma discourses 1
unpleasantarticulate sound im going merely guess 1
decideyourself whether im right wrong would echothat criticizing 1
echos coming cliff thats asound arising elements conjoined consciousness 1
soi think possesses definition 1
non articulatesounds pleasant unpleasant 1
pleasant one would thesound well played musical instrument unpleasant onewould sound well played musical instrument 1
iused orchestra hear person justlearning play violin painful? 1
course theyget good different story beginning 1
sothats sounds 1
next odors 1
defined objects perceivedby olfactory consciousness 1
theres different divisions suchas fragrant odors unfragrant odors 1
refers somethingthat smells nice something doesnt smell nice ofthese two divisions 1
equal unequal 1
equal odorwhether fragrant unfragrant would one equalwith everything else doesnt dominate 1
whereas unequalone case fragrant odor would perfume thatdominates everything else enter room 1
case ofthe unfragrant dominate odor example would smell ofgarlic 1
different divisions; products indianmentality particular indian scholars sat triedto figure everything could known put itsproper category 1
sat analyze odors notjust question odors; question fragrant odorsunfragrant odors subtle odors strong odors etc 1
come tastes object special fondness thiscountry 1
six types; way taste defined asthe object gustatory consciousness 1
sweet sour hot andsalty bitter astringent 1
whats spice solu khumbu? 1
astringent would flavor erma 1
actually erma issaid flavors 1
astringent somehow dries yourtongue shrivels 1
different objects including tastes made ofthe four elements 1
example sweet taste arises apreponderance earth water element sour fireand earth salt flavor water fire hot fire andwind bitter water wind astringency earth andwind 1
come tactile objects objects perceivedby tactile consciousness 1
two groups: elementsand tangible objects arisen elements 1
theelements mentioned earth water fire wind 1
earth hard obstructive; water wet cohesive; fire ishot burning; air light moving thing younever one elements without another one 1
smallestparticles said made eight things 1
theyre madeout four elements made visualobject olfactory gustatory tactile 1
theres auditoryparticle sound something produce acontinuum ones 1
particles thatmake forms get smallest particlesare particles made eight components thoseparticles dominance one element another 1
sotherefore see fire doesnt mean nowater element 1
fire element isdominating time 1
example fires ability supporta piece paper leaf 1
instance throw piece ofpaper leaf fire doesnt immediately float itsheld 1
ability function earth element part offire 1
also way tongues flames firecan merge together thats water element fire 1
thefact fire move air element part fireand course fire something see touch andso forth 1
even though fire defined terms tactileconsciousness still something see issomething included components fire 1
might water contain elements? 1
body ofwater might contain elements 1
instancewater support ship thats earth element youput plant water eventually decay thats itsfire element 1
water flow hill thats airelement 1
winds earth element support kinds objects asleaves wind blows clothes dry thatsits fire element 1
wind tornado moves together thatsits water element 1
take two stones certain stones hit togetheryou get spark thats fire element earth factthat parts board hold together cells dontdisintegrate hold together water element ofearth 1
things like trees move thats wind element airelement 1
didnt mean walking! 1
move grow 1
like whenever one element theother elements may find one elements dominatesthe ones 1
theres tangible objects besides theelements; smooth rough heavy light cold hungerthirst said arise four elements 1
smoothness arises dominance fire water roughnessfrom earth water heavy earth water light fireand wind cold water wind hunger wind adominance wind thirst dominance fire 1
theseparticles seen color depending whichelement dominating shapes depend upon arrangementof color particles 1
forms mental consciousness? 1
forms objects mentalconsciousness 1
one called form arising aggregation orcollection 1
small particles make gross objects thatwe see hear forth cant seen senseshowever mental consciousness know particles 1
forinstance dont think anybody seen electron knowabout dont we? 1
would form mentalconsciousness particular one form arising fromaggregation 1
another one called space form one difficult toappear mind similar space appears toa visual consciousness 1
instance space thatappears visual consciousness gap betweenourselves object across room gap issomething changeable 1
change color instanceit get dark get smog colored city instanceor clear 1
something changeablephenomena seen eyes likewise oneis using mental consciousness see space 1
aswhen shut eyes imagine something far away 1
thenarent cognizant space object faraway distance? 1
one appearing yourvisual consciousness thats appearing mentalconsciousness space form included object ofmental consciousness one distinguish space fromwhat known permanent space 1
permanent space negationof obstruction extension 1
example space wecan see middle room somebody might wonder isthere enough space pass look youlook size person say see noobstruction prevent person passing 1
thatabsence obstruction known permanent space 1
iscalled permanent last forever ratherbecause thing changes moment moment 1
itis dynamic energy mere absence obstructiontherefore called permanent 1
theres nothing permanent five aggregates! 1
fiveaggregates said include impermanent phenomena 1
butthere impermanent phenomena permanentphenomena 1
another type form contained form mentalconsciousness would form arising promise 1
forexample person takes vow said subtle formarises certain people super knowledge see 1
ioften wonder form created taking vows looks likeafter twenty years 1
maybe like holey rag! 1
forms arise one making virtuouspromises either 1
dependence upon butchers physical andverbal actions killing animals selling fleshalso form arise 1
maybe may relationship known asauras 1
imaginary forms elephants dream 1
form really actually made ofparticles physical particles thats called animaginary form appears mental consciousness 1
theres forms one meditative power thiswould form person special power cangenerate others see 1
theres different types here;theres type lasts long meditator isconcentrating theres type remain even whenthe meditator something else 1
okay deals form aggregate 1
lets take break 1
id like begin afternoon questions camefrom mornings lecture 1
lot information long questionlike could repeat said morning would happyto answer 1
q: morning pende said first three theaggregates linked desire 1
forth one volitionnot linked desire? 1
a: fourth one explained mainly basis volitionas mentioned said volition thing askarma fact cant say volition karma onlythe volition control ignorance known askarma 1
thus negative desire product ignorance thenthe volition controlled desire certainly thisphenomena known karma 1
way course way relating fourth aggregatewith desire entirely necessary buddhawhen explaining five aggregates away point person acquired fiveaggregates bound cyclic existence 1
person bound incyclic existence mental addictions karma 1
instance say volition controlled desirethus investigate volition important see thatis case wherever volition goes thats sixconsciousnesses go thats specific function ofvolition take consciousness respectiveobject 1
another question? 1
q: mean volition? 1
a: okay thats coming 1
could even say thingas power intention 1
q: isnt auditory object sound included sameway sensory objects are? 1
a: answer given sound doesnt produce acontinuum insufficient 1
sound understood something arises forinstance hitting one object another objectsdont come contact sound produced thecase one foundation particle composed eightparts sound isnt included object notmaking sound 1
separate particle inaddition eight could say sound twoof particles collided possible soundcould produced 1
q: nothing produce sound thesame objects like tactile objects olfactoryobjects dont see something objecta visual object cannot see taste object icannot taste 1
a: nothing produces soundsound produced 1
instance particle strikes eardrum sound produced 1
types particles aremoving space strike ear drum call soundwaves 1
system thought foundationparticles move bring sound noparticular particle sound whereas particularparticle visual form particularparticle odor forth 1
particles saidto evolution developments four elements 1
avisual particle forth somehow made fourelements take object touch thereason touch tactile objectquality taste forth listenthe sound might hear due particle soundbut rather movement particles 1
thats best 1
q: good desires dont give birth cyclicexistence? 1
a: mental factor volition said called karma inthe case control ignorance 1
cases wherewe read order become liberated cease karmait mean bring end instances ofthis mental factor volition 1
means bring anend dominance control volition mentaladdictions volition basic function taking themind object whatever also operating mindof buddha without volition mind would ableto make contact object 1
thus buddha would knowthings buddha would compassion whichperceives sentient beings 1
volition necessary function ofconsciousness 1
want know something notparticularly easy mind know object haveto wish 1
wish desire callit aspiration motivates discoverthat object 1
course actions following thathopefully bring object want toexperience objects worth experiencing othersare 1
wish aspiration positive desire isbrought wisdom consciousness clear intelligencethen going get us trouble 1
particular isbrought wisdom consciousness perceives realitythen wont cause type volitional activity bringsabout uncontrolled death rebirth known cyclicexistence 1
interesting contemplate existence without desireat 1
would anything desirewhatsoever? 1
types actions would happen would actionslike falling 1
course desire whatsoeveryou would never stood 1
observationsthere thought path liberation theend desire thus engaged practice totalinactivity sought achieve stopping mindfrom generating desire 1
process theydiscovered takes time stop mind generatingdesire 1
pursued practice total inactivity theymight starve death reached mental state nodesire desire employed get andget food stuff type activity seen asactivity leading bondage leading toliberation 1
interesting question becomes isit going stop mind desire? 1
forinstance desire whatsoever assaying aspiration would liberation thisperson seeking look like? 1
would kind state ofutter non-existence? 1
movement taking placeat would 1
perhaps idea typeof liberation based upon experience deep sleep 1
thatstate direct experience infer ourmemory lost consciousness regained itagain perfected state experienceof buddha 1
buddha quite active benefiting sentient beings 1
instance buddha want benefit sentient beings sowe cultivate practitioners 1
theproblem trying distinguish negative desire andthe positive desire often happens refer tonegative desires positive desires 1
would much easier ifwe could sort block desire whatsoever sayits negative 1
would nearly attractive theultimate goal? 1
ultimate goal plan mostmaterialists 1
betting death nothing 1
achieve without even meditating one minute itsjust going arise naturally breath stops 1
courseits interesting nothing know likethat 1
seems like everything always remains something asin theory conservation energy energy ever lostit transforms something else 1
belief thematerialist like dogmatic belief 1
theres evidencefor nobody ever come back state nothingnessto say 1
okay questions 1
color necessarily object visualconsciousness 1
a: instance small particles acolor visual consciousness cant perceive theyreobjects mental consciousness 1
objects mentalconsciousness called phenomena visual objects soundssmells forth also phenomena arent 1
mean objects mental consciousnessare objects five consciousnesses? 1
answer phenomena objectsof mental consciousness referring objectsthat arent included objects first five senseconsciousnesss color small particle oreven small particle etc 1
consciousnesssand forth q: mental consciousness perceive visual form grossvisual form subtle? 1
a: yes mentioned example visualconsciousness perceiving blue color cause mentalconsciousness 1
mean gross object? 1
mean something thats disgusting? 1
although sometimes thats mean bygross context gross object means object thatscomposed many particles table 1
made manyparticles basic particle forms table thateight fold particle 1
think hardness thistable comes earth element wood stickstogether comes water element 1
rub woodwith another piece wood theoretically fire come thiscomes fire element must movementthere otherwise dont think youd get nail go woodand thats air element 1
see table thats dueto visual particles 1
think could even taste tabledue taste particles forth 1
visual form sound smell forth areall made particles developments thefour elements four elements contained tactileobjects 1
arent included amongst visual objects orodors something like that? 1
tactile consciousness wemainly know elements 1
earth known hardness hardness knownthrough tactile consciousness 1
water known wetness andthat perceived tactile consciousness 1
fire known itsbeing hot thats perceived tactile consciousness air byits lightness thats experienced tactile consciousness 1
without tactile consciousness would way knowthose elements 1
thats included objects thetactile consciousness 1
keep questions answers mind beable pass test sunday afternoon 1
im joking 1
leave form aggregate behind deal fouraggregates included mind 1
first mean mind clear andknowing 1
clear describes reality formless 1
buddhismasserts mind made form composedof physical particles therefore reduced toelectromagnetic energy 1
therefore brain itsnot neurons electrical energy passing throughthose neurons mere name referring objects 1
one theory mind merely epi phenomena whichis name referring example according tothis way seeing chair could called epi phenomenabecause chair fact legs seat theback thats chair 1
talk chair ifit gestalt something greater sum partssomething sum parts 1
likewise aretalking mind people would say reallytalking electro- chemical responses going inthe body run trouble philosophically withthat position talking mind nottalking body talking electro-chemical responses going body 1
materialistreductionists would like eliminate language mindfrom language 1
would like eliminate theycant would like say type language initself meaningless internal consistency butwhats really going accounts experience forthis electro-chemical reactions body 1
presssome body adheres philosophy observableevidence base philosophy would giveexamples cases injecting certain chemicals inthe brain removing certain parts brain forthyou bring different experiences like making catfear mouse mouse brave attack cat 1
brain damage eliminate memories whole parts ofones life electrical stimulation differentparts brain cause things gustatoryconsciousness arise various memories occur 1
person adheres non physical nature mindwill say events merely describing relationshipbetween body mind identity body andmind stimulating physical organ mentalexperience take place 1
relationship alreadyasserted buddhism 1
instance said fivephysical faculties upon five sense consciousnessesdepend 1
faculties damaged way theconsciousnesses affected also quick topoint body affects mind themind affect body 1
example visualizing certainchannels body concentrating certain visualizedpoints channels change temperature thebody radically 1
course thats extraordinary example butthere many ordinary ones 1
instance reason camehere necessarily physical itch rather werereasons mind coming 1
certainmental diseases treated successfully chemicalsthere many mental disorders best treated usingthe mind 1
example desire bmw 1
say 240 turbodrive black tinted black windows lot trunk space 1
ifyou desire money pay itthen best solution take prozac otherchemical agent rather contemplate difficultiesyou would experience debt rest life howthat would last longer life car thatcar solve problems therell still beyou driving alone hungry looking place drive toand running gas 1
thinking like replace image car beingthe important thing world although may notreplace desire work slowly 1
whereas thechemicals may deal desire causing euphoricstate may think dont need anything itmay cause dullness mind couldnt botheryourself generate desires come thechemical desires arise best beseen temporary solutions everybody recognizes thebest solution would mental solution insight thatsees reality situation 1
insight gained thinking process 1
notgained taking pills well balanced diet withexercise 1
shows difference mindand body 1
person physically veryhealthy mentally mess 1
likewise somebody ismentally clear friendly soft etc 1
physically amess 1
kinds examples illustrate difference innature mind body theres many others 1
dramatic examples find experimentsthat take place parapsychology phenomena cantbe explained physical laws existence bedenied shouldnt take word somethingyou study 1
people veryobvious others belief something thatis supported conviction particular conviction thatsbased sound reasoning direct observation consequently thatbelief could easily shaken back mind theremight subtle hope time death every thingceases one wont worry bad karma onehas accumulating 1
mind clear meaningformless doesnt mean doesnt exist 1
exists ithas function cognition 1
apprehends objects anapprehension known knowing cognizing isdynamic energetic physical energy isnon less functioning obviously 1
apply law ofconservation energy 1
theres reason shouldsuddenly stop physical energies keep going oneway another 1
well make anything sound reasonable justbecause something sounds reasonable doesnt mean thats theway 1
yet examples people seem confirmthe existence continuum mental energy thechildren remember former lives whose reports arecorroborated authoritative researchers 1
anybody ever heard great philosopher mathematiciannamed pascal? 1
"pascals wager" 1
ever heard pascals-wager 1
youre going 1
benefit haventheard think french said preparefor next life isnt next life youll noregrets wont around 1
dont prepare anext life next life youll big regrets 1
sotheres nothing lose preparing next life andeverything gain! 1
mean mind clear knowing 1
youknow knowing right opposite knowing isknowing 1
know exact population france moment? 1
nothing comes mind 1
thats knowing theres anapprehension object appearance seenby eyes forth 1
know human population ofyour house? 1
suddenly something comes mind thats knowing mental factors mind function perceive thequalities object respond various ways thefeatures object 1
main minds mental factors relatedby one substance main mind aremental factors substance main mindor could say mind general thing clearand knowing various functions one functions iscalled main mind functions called mentalfactors 1
take moment mind moments knowingof object entity object called main mindand moment minds knowing various features makeup object called mental factors 1
two fold division mind main mind mental factorsis likened community 1
within community adirector whose job know whats happening general thecommunity also community would cook whosejob take care preparation food 1
thedirector know something whats going thekitchen doesnt know everything thats job ofthe cook 1
thats example heard long time ago firststudied stuff 1
little bit illuminating much 1
rather prefer explanation moment mindthen different functions divided main mindand mental factors distinguish main minds frommental factors one mental factor another way ofdistinguishing one function another function theyre stillall functions moment mind 1
main mind attendant mental factors fivesimilarities 1
first objectof observation example take visual main mind itsattendant mental factors perceiving blue color 1
bluecolor object observation visual main mind andits attendant mental factors taking object ofobservation blue color 1
second similarity similar aspect aspect means amind perceives object aspect image thatobject appears consciousness object isplaced front mirror image object appears inthat mirror case example image called areflection case consciousness image called anaspect 1
said instance take piece clearcrystal like one nice pieces cut differentfacets around clear put niceblue clothe crystal appear blue color 1
likewise consciousness perceiving object takeson aspect object say areperceiving objects perceiving aspects mindwe perceiving objects 1
main mind attendant mental factors sameaspect also occur simultaneously therefore nothave cause affect relationship 1
main mind itsattendant mental factors faculty itsdominant condition 1
example main visual consciousness andits attendant mental factors eye faculty theirdominant condition 1
also said similar substance example thefeeling mental factor would attendant visualconsciousness would found consciousness 1
reason mentioning five similarities getaway idea main minds mental factors beoperating independently different times theyreall substance 1
six main minds visual mental main minds andthose constitute consciousness aggregate fifthof five aggregates 1
mental factors compose thesecond third forth aggregate 1
know theres exhaustion far following me? 1
q: repeat five please? 1
a: object observation aspect time duration theduration simultaneous dominant condition similar substance 1
fifty one mental factors hope lot inkin pens actually theres lot fifty onewere mentioned give idea variousfunctions mind 1
functions identifiedprincipally perspective brings happiness andwhat brings suffering perspective someonein meditative tradition 1
another perspective may beable find many mental factors even theperspective tradition mental factorsbeside list fifty one 1
fifty one mental factors fall five categories 1
first known omnipresent mental factors 1
secondis object ascertaining mental factors virtuousmental factors next root afflictions nextare secondary afflictions last variable mentalfactors 1
five plus one 1
five omnipresent mental factors according eitherthe abhidharmakosha abhidharmasamuccaya 1
abhidharmakoshahas different list five similarities 1
im saying isthat presentation im giving based upon certaintexts 1
authoritative buddhist scholars samepresentation 1
instance fifty one mental factors mentionedby asanga text abhidharmasamuccaya 1
younger brothervasubandhu wrote text abhidharmakosha text onlymentioned forty eight mental factors 1
remember correctly onetext group five similarities main minds andmental factors thats different ones one textsays theres five omnipresent mental factors onesays theres ten 1
lord buddha one gave monks vows hes sourceof monks vows number different traditionsthat arisen years vows 1
instance thetradition discipline exists tibet known themulasarvastivadan 1
thailand tradition known theravadan tradition 1
mulasarvastivadan tradition 253 vows fullyordained monk whereas theravadan tradition 227 1
seems like tibetans vows 1
theyget based buddha? 1
well fact allof contained 227 theravadan tradition 1
theyjust different way enumerating 1
like youhave different scholars different ways ofenumerating things cant say differencesindicate one right wrong usuallyhave reasons system 1
omnipresent means every moment mind thesefive omnipresent mental factors operating therefore one knowimplicitly every moment mind necessarily haveall 51 mental factors operating fiveomnipresent ones 1
theres feeling 1
hear name dont immediately assumeyou know means employ names already havecommon usage respective languages specificdefinitions context 1
definition feeling amental factor nature experience individuallyexperiencing fruition virtuous non virtuous actions 1
become clear shortly 1
objects pleasure pain neitherpleasure pain 1
feeling mental factor thatexperiences pleasure pain neutral experiences 1
pleasure isthat ceases want meet 1
pain thatexperience arises want separate theneutral experience one arises neither want toseparate meet 1
experiences arise fromprevious actions undertaken 1
virtuousactions produce pleasure non virtuous producepain fact words virtuous non virtuous used merelybecause one produces pleasure produces pain 1
whatwe want pleasure happiness action brings iscalled virtuous declared virtuous anomnipotent another word good getsus want whereas non virtuous action produces pain 1
emphasizes experiences pleasure andpain come without causes causes someunrelated entity 1
pain happiness issomething bestowed upon us deity rather theycome former actions therefore thecreators future experience person ourprevious continuum creator present experiences 1
need visit clairvoyant pay lot moneyto know former lifetime know whatyoure going next lifetime 1
look presentexperience youll know kind person thepast look present activity youll know kind ofexperience youll future 1
knowledge certain knowledge virtuous actionbrings happiness non virtuous action brings suffering ishighly esteemed certainty something ishighly esteemed 1
praised basis auspiciousdoctrines called correct view buddhists 1
buddhists vary call correct view reality butthey agree virtuous actions bring happiness 1
buddhistsdisagree regard correct view realityreality one subtle things subtlethe buddha gave different accounts differentdisciples came hear consequently havedifferent philosophical schools agree virtuebrings happiness non virtue brings suffering 1
happy lifeat end one could say "not bad could beenworse" created virtuous action 1
experiences thatoccur life good bad also created actionsvirtuous non virtuous 1
develop conviction butit difficult know exactly actions 1
okay lets stop today 1
lets sit quietly fewminutes give chance sink 1
listening subject important listen insuch way teaching becomes antidote thecauses problems 1
among numerous causes problems wecan say theres two types: external internal 1
externalcauses problems familiar us badweather obnoxious people kinds things wehear complaints every day read papers andsee tv 1
happiness dependent theelimination outer causes problems whole taskwould hopeless theres definite guarantee anyexternal condition become cause problems 1
forinstance best friends turn us beautifulhome become prison tropical beach become boring aholiday become death sentence 1
theres nothing trust inthe external circumstances 1
internal causes problems 1
internalcauses problems anger clinging forthjealousy sorts minds 1

themajor obstacle human various faultsthis main one 1
thanka known "the wheel life"--that last one hanging often painted abuddha five six realms cyclic existence andeach buddhas carrying something represents theantidote main suffering respective realm thebuddha human realm carrying staff bowl amonk whereas hungry ghost realm hes carrying water andfood 1
hungry ghosts suffer hunger andthirst mainly humans humans suffer fromdesire 1
thats gross generalization youeliminate conditions war illness poverty thoseextremes human suffering find world yousee many human beings destroyed desire 1
sometimes marriages fail desire somebody otherthan partner adultery may result oneor people married falling level ofstatus society 1
politicians werehonored society well supreme court judges highcourt judges honored society theirsexual misconduct theres big scandal fall fromtheir position 1
teachers sexual relations studentsand lose position teachers 1
areall people plenty food clothing shelter andmedicine stuff 1
like people trying end war wherethey like sarajevo bosnia hercegovina 1
well oncethey eliminate war look forward sufferinglike every one else 1
right theyre suffering gross waybut comes suffering uncontrolled desire wheretheres always something missing 1
something weall try transcend generally main way dothat weighing disadvantages whatever benefitwed get followed desire 1
disadvantages arereally horrendous advantage following desire isvery small much easier give desire 1
unfortunately always clear consequentlyits difficult give desire stays onejust endure 1
arises thought "i wonder ifthere state mind free desire justdoesnt arise one could cruise life likethe wind 1
touch things leave notcarrying free" 1
theres zen story 1
two zen monks master disciplecome river old story may heard itbefore 1
theres beautiful woman whos trying cross riverbut needs help 1
master picks carries heracross river 1
according discipline shouldnt betouching woman disciple thinking soon side river master disciple carried ontheir journey sometime disciple couldnt holdhimself back anymore said master could pick woman? 1
master said important thing put river wascrossed hand still carryingher 1
imagine free desire? 1
free would be! 1
could enjoy anything put second thoughtsand im talking attitude cad dont knowwhat youd call 1
im talking attitude ofsomebody love affairs disposes likethat one night stands 1
im talking 1
theresnothing high thats somebody whos really possessedby desire cant get satisfaction 1
im talking aboutsomething quite different 1
freedom desire exists get itwhen enter form realm generate form realmmentality desire objects senses doesnt ariseany 1
generate form realm mentality requires cultivation ofconcentration type concentration staysingle pointedly object hours 1
generates ownkind mental physical ecstasy eclipses pleasureof desire realm 1
unfortunately easy tocultivate 1
well least nice know possible butbecause easy theres people havethat freedom desire consequently even people whomake profession desireless hard time 1
thats scandals religious orders 1
main way controlling desire like everybodyelses 1
advantage may amount thatthey separate objects desire forinstance cloisters 1
usually scandals occur peoplewho dont separation 1
good old days concentration easier cultivatethey say im sure think always bit difficult 1
monastery thousand people probably ahandful could thing us sameproblem long pleasurable feeling thenattachment arise unless youve abandoned attachment 1
letssay attachment likes pleasurable feelings sowhenever pleasurable feeling arises theres danger ofattachment 1
attachment arises youve lost freedom 1
usually dont buy many things consequently dont muchinterest shopping walk street shops theimpression mind things go shoppingfor instance buy computer walk shop thatsells computers even ive already bought computer cantjust walk shop thinking thing 1
mind gets stuck ihave stop walking look things especially theprice see paid mine 1
might get upset ofthese things didnt happen 1
thats simpleexample many examples theattachment arises mind gets stuck object 1
thenthroughout day mind keeps object comes upagain find mind plotting order get thatobject 1
find voice reason getting weaker andweaker voice cleverness getting louder louder soyoure stuck youve lost freedom therefore buddha said wehave guard doors senses 1
pleasurable feeling negative theattachment thats negative feeling ethical quality 1
pleasurable feelings arent virtuous painful feelings arent nonvirtuous 1
pleasurable feelings tend give riseto mind clinging attachment painful feelings giverise anger 1
also interesting keep mind apleasurable feeling result virtuous karma thatsthe case object cause pleasurablefeeling enabled pleasurable feeling occur assunshine 1
one point view pleasurable feelingexperiencing sunshine depends upon sunshine thesource pleasurable feeling pleasurable aprevious virtuous action 1
like cant crop withouta field keeping mind rather regarding thevarious objects sources happiness one pursuevirtuous action kind enthusiasm use topursue pleasurable objects 1
okay next aggregate discrimination 1
alsoa mental factor omnipresent mental factor oneapprehends uncommon signs object 1
object hascharacteristics shares common objects andcharacteristics unique uniquecharacteristics enable us differentiate one object fromanother 1
discrimination function mind thatapprehends unique characteristics isdiscrimination find accompanying sense consciousnessesand accompanying mental consciousnesses mentalconsciousnesses conceptual consciousnesses itis conceptual consciousness person knows languagethat discrimination differentiate objects bymeans names 1
discrimination mental factor thatapplies names identifies objects names 1
sensoryconsciousness doesnt name objects nonetheless beclear different objects 1
clearly differentiate sayyellow red 1
discrimination enables us recognize differentiate theobjects make reality 1
one functions sensory consciousness isoperating basis clear distinctperceptions conceptual discrimination mental factor namedifferent objects similarly hearing true words inyour mind youre identifying certain things giving names tothose things youre identifying thats also discrimination 1
also identify something good depending upon ithaving signs reasons thats also discrimination 1
theres discrimination reasoned discrimination 1
isone skilled relating names objects alsothat able observe appropriate qualities soundis impermanent 1
also theres discrimination clearaspect clear object 1
opposed unreasoneddiscrimination one unskilled relating nameswith meaning child yet learn anylanguage discrimination thinks sound ispermanent discrimination lacks clear subjectiveaspect object 1
last type unreasoned discrimination thediscrimination operates highest level formlessrealm clear aspect clear objectappearing mind 1
really useful state togenerate comes belief discrimination thisfaculty discrimination source problems 1
uncommon read criticism discrimination 1
forinstance number spiritual texts would describe theultimate state somehow unified state 1
expressionsas one 1
course discrimination differentiatesidentifies differentiates seems contradict allis one experience description based upon meredescription high state mind one somepsychologists misunderstood high state mind 1
instance child psychology recognition asan infant child doesnt discriminate subject andobject 1
clear subjective ego awareness yet arise thechild 1
sometimes called oceanic awareness 1
one placecarl jung thought high realizations yogis wasrecovering state mind possessed infant 1
elevating primitive consciousness exulted state 1
thats said another place freud referred tosuch high experiences yogis infantile regressionsthinking non infant 1
thiswould devaluing exulted state making primitivestate 1
theres big difference lacking discriminationand transcending discrimination 1
infant doesnt havediscrimination subject object 1
yogi suchdiscrimination within discrimination able todiscriminate something transcends subject objectand order even powerfuldiscrimination people 1
far achieving highstates mind eliminating discrimination states mindare achieved making ones mind much powerful 1
another type discrimination called discrimination thesmall discrimination mind person thedesire realm 1
theres another discrimination known asdiscrimination vast discrimination mindof person form realm point view theform realm experiences desire realm small andquite insignificant 1
theres discrimination thelimitless discrimination found firsttwo states formless realm one discriminateslimitless space limitless consciousness 1
theresdiscrimination nothingness third state theformless realm one doesnt discriminate anything thatstate like unconscious 1
also mistake 1
differentstates mind achieved people striving hardfor liberation striving discovered thesecret liberation mind key forliberation mind 1
stumbled upon thetremendous capacity concentration amazingtool tried achieve liberation merely 1
concentration thatenabled turn parts mind trying achieveliberation making unconscious instance 1
theresno pain theres experience 1
experimenting kinds ofmanipulation mind concentration means thisthey could achieve whats known peak cyclic existencein various disturbing negative thoughts thedesire realm form realm formless realm peakcease functioning 1
become free 1
problemis faults peak remain doesnt haveanything higher peak get rid faults unlessyou use something else besides concentration 1
thing theymiss wisdom perceiving emptiness thewisdom realizing emptiness totally abandon faultsof cyclic existence even without generate highpower concentration 1
thats discrimination aggregate 1
q: explained seems though community ofdifferent tendencies 1
possible feelingof oneness 1
feeling self permanence? 1
a: first seeing self one thing 1
verycommon phenomena think comes capacity toconceptualize means categorize differentthings instance crowd people actually many peoplebut differentiate one crowd another crowd 1
canhave one crowd many crowds practicalfunctions capacity something useful 1
forinstance composed body mind 1
saybody body includes many things rather listall things theres end justcountless atoms body even things seethat things see knife discriminationare still many mention 1
capacity thinkbody means including parts thebody parts body 1
also forourselves useful refer possesses thebody mind expressions "my body" "my mind" 1
wedont mean something get walk awayleaving body mind behind way owner car canget leave car way organizeour experiences describe actions ability toconstruct things thoughts useful means ofthis differentiate one thing another 1
problemoccurs take thought constructs forget infact thought constructs start thinking theyhave independent life 1
based upon beliefthat independent life also based uponthe fact doesnt appear change one view aspermanent refer using samepronouns day day also thinking inthe past thinking referring inthe future thus appears iis changing exactly 1
moreif exists life would bepermanent 1
wouldnt depending anything else ascauses exist analyze point closer seethat although name may remain indeedchanged 1
fact would sad state remained exactlythe children 1
thing weseldom analyze take things appear 1
thisperson person ourself thought constructhaving functions terms practical discrimination andlanguage appears life isactually apprehended life 1
thisapprehension ignorance misknowledge wasrecognized buddha root source thesuffering 1
anything question couldaddress 1
q: described different levels concentration accordingto realm repeat please 1
a: interesting one would form formless realm 1
firsttheres desire realm concentration notdistinguished special 1
discriminationassociated one called discrimination thesmall objects recognize small qualityin comparison objects recognized form andformless realm 1
form formless realm start tofind special types concentration 1
form realm thediscrimination known discrimination vastthat objects identified form realm arevastly superior desire realm 1
formlessrealm said superior form realm iswithout faults found form realm withinthe formless realm different types discrimination 1
formless realm theres four levels known limitlessspace limitless consciousness nothingness fourth iscalled neither sensation sensation 1
fourth level isalso called peak cyclic existence 1
discriminationfound first two known discrimination ofthe limitless found third level known thediscrimination nothingness discrimination found thefourth level type unreasoned discrimination 1
thetype clear subjective aspect clearobject observation 1
lets take break 1
next aggregate one known variously compositionalfactors intention mental factors areincluded aggregate 1
im using way volitionintention synonymously 1
well begin mental factor intention somepeople consider important mental factorsand defined mental factor moves directs themind accompanies object functionof engaging mind virtue non virtue activitiesthat neither virtuous non virtuous 1
something extremely powerful causes mindto engage object helplessly like metal filings tohelplessly follow magnet 1
drag magnet metalfilings follow choice 1
sometimes happens person notices theyre notin control life would like go particulardirection helplessly going another direction 1
striking makes wonder whos incharge? 1
expressions "this body mymind 1
"i want dont want 1
howcome body mind dont go way want go 1
"remember described person mere mentalconstruct aside qualities might conceptually giveit doesnt qualities 1
instance youhave thought walking ability walk actuallyborrowed body words body iswalking one thought walking 1
like thebody walking also walking sort walkinghand hand 1
likewise thought goingto fact mental factor thinking itthat impulse produces activity basisof impulse thought "i" 1
itsthat impulse thats actual creator things thats whyits considered important theres also thatsdesignated depending upon feeling feel pain ifeel pleasure thoughts theres thefeeling mental factor experiencing pain pleasure thenthere conceptual process invents characterknown ""i" basis 1
experiences derived creator functionof intention 1
would like kind offeelings would would pleasurable sort basisof thought "i" 1
order happen creatorintention going virtuous direction thuswe virtuous person mental factor intentionis directing us virtuously 1
mental factor intention susceptible persuasion 1
doesnt exist independent othermental factors 1
often something arises aconsiderable amount thinking 1
like make adecision whether go long trip 1
youuse faculties discrimination forth weigh theadvantages disadvantages trip 1
think aboutbeing place pleasurable experience may arise causingthe desire meet object also influences thethinking process 1
might painful experience associatedwith place youre staying causing thought separatefrom soon possible 1
also influence thinkingprocess certain point thinking concludes inthis intention 1
intention starts taking themind direction point youre along forthe ride like surfer wave accurately thoughtconstruct designated basis intention thats inmotion 1
every conscious action intention going either avirtuous non virtuous way neutral way 1
actingcontinuously throughout day numerous intentions thatwe set intentions dont necessarily cease immediately 1
lets say example going place intention ofgoing place take place thecase process intentionality totally stops youget 1
whole process something thats remembered inthe mind repeat many differenteffects 1
anyway whole thing subject karma imgoing move 1
instance effectseven life instance time death saidthat person goes death process havenumerous visions people near death experiencesreport experience whole life flashing infront 1
seen life flash front themit causes make evaluation 1
certain things lifestand others identify strongly acertain type behavior behaviors witnessin visions 1
using language description ofintention arises latent state process ofintentionality operating past wentlatent due circumstances death becameactive due association thethought "i" relation intentionality process yougo another ride case intentionality ittakes "you" mere thought construct basis 1
itstaking without body youve left behind 1
however may case intentionality get itsobject get aim need physical body 1
itonly uses physical body necessary get aimand theres great many varieties physical bodies 1
youraim example intention going trip togo south winter intentionality thathappens resurrect time death maybe allyou need accomplish body bird becausethe mind linked specific type body 1
bodyis vehicle mind body due ownnature allows certain kinds mental experiences take place 1
ways could say rebirth dominantcondition experience life mind comingtogether certain kind body gives mind accessto certain kind experience 1
unique characteristic thehuman body nervous system supports unlimiteddevelopment intelligence 1
therefore human body bestsort body person aspiring liberationbecause order get liberation develop thispenetrative insight way things exist 1
doesnt meanjust kind human body 1
human body hasall senses working properly human body place inwhich easy difficult find thenecessities life 1
cant difficult thatsthe case never free time explore questionsas things exist way 1
know peoplethat dismiss thoughts useless philosophy theyhave get work making money supportingtheir various responsibilities 1
life easy thatis also problem mind gets sluggish thustheres incentive cultivation intelligence ithas somewhat challenging human beings rely upon theirintelligence survive 1
thats practice person whois mainly trying achieve higher rebirth consists thepractice ethics 1
many types ethics one type ethics ethicsof restraint restraining action thatwill bring immediate pleasure recognize inthe long run going problematic although theexperience denying oneself pleasure painful one cansee long run going great benefit 1
soeven animal see whats immediately front inthis case person practicing ethics whats immediately infront person pleasure pain donttake 1
enables person restrain bemiserable ability imagine something future whichthe animals cant 1
requires quite development ofintelligence 1
one exercising intelligence order get agreater benefit even cost short term sacrifice 1
thatis especially case person sacrificing thepotential experiences life order get even betterthings future life life tangible issomething see whether futurelife cant tell seeing tasting smelling 1
onlyknow intelligence 1
person trying toget good rebirth avoid bad rebirth donethrough power intelligence person isputting higher priority use intelligence thanjust instincts taking pleasurable trying toget rid immediately painful 1
person islikely reborn type body willsupport development intelligence 1
wouldget instance human body place would haveaccess type education could learn abouthigher higher states happiness 1
questions that? 1
wish wrong 1
think thats dharma says 1
thats buddhahad mind 1
even though hate hear 1
due kindnessof teachers cant help say thosethings 1
say dharma like mirror mirror issomething use see dirt faceso wash similarly dharma issomething use see faults anymistaken conduct forth 1
eliminate thosefaults change conduct 1
fact one might squirma little bit feel uncomfortable one hearing dharmadoesnt mean wrong 1
q: possible volition bring us activitieshelplessly possible influence volition inthis case influence intention 1
a: many mental factors beside intention forinstance talking generating intention gosomewhere whole thought process led 1
absolute specific intention ariseits like whole package ready go dependent uponvarious conditions instance power ofintelligence determine aim specificintention undesirable therefore dont allow thatintention arise 1
also intention usually taking placewithin context person persons environment andso person various likes dislikes theintention means person able get whatthey want avoid dont want force theintention dependent upon way person isperceived 1
instance youre dreaming youre chased bysome monster dream intention get away fromthat monster dependent upon believing real inthat dream 1
intention get away doesnt arise isnobody really escape thing reallyfrightening 1
like buddha discovered degreeof reality attribute isactually discover empty thatextra reality intentionalities createdin past dependent upon exaggerated view ofoneself longer control oneself 1
thats oneis liberated 1
thats whole thrust buddhasteachings emphasis buddhas teachings thediscovery actuality true reality person 1
sometimes people hear teaching karma therecomes mind idea predetermination arelocked experience process cant anythingabout intention something arises causesand conditions causes conditions notthings fixed get control karma 1
inother words get control intention 1
complicated question asked_ study lot becomes clear becausethe buddha dharma many topics within 1
anexpression cant see forest treeswhich means youre forest see theindividual trees theres many idea forestdoesnt come mind likewise studying thedetails dharma unified view overview doesnt come tomind 1
instance yesterday talked must bea continuation mind although wasnt everything canbe said im going spend time 1
said today possibility animalmind preta mind forth thats true 1
casethat human generate mind form realm andformless realm also actual states rebirth ahuman generate certain types concentration thatare concentrations form formless realms also thehuman generate animal minds hungry ghost minds andjust person takes rebirth form formless realmsbecause generating form formless concentrations sothe human take rebirth animal ofgenerating animalistic mentality 1
certain times inour life states mind appear evidently evenhave expressions like person behaving unreasonablyfearfully may say theyre "chicken" theres lot theseexpressions animal names given certain types ofbehavior thats behavior doesnt conform withthe dignity human 1
one dies type mentality active getthe body best accords mentality likewise withliberation 1
liberation state peace one pacifiedof disturbing negative thoughts forceduncontrollably take rebirth 1

presentation eight consciousnesses sixthat first mentioned seventh one known theafflicted consciousness eighth one known thefoundation consciousness 1
different schools ofthought 1
cittamatrin following reasoning asserts sixconsciousnesses even school cant agree 1
thecittamatrin school following scripture would refer suchscriptures buddha lankavatara sutra mentionsthe eight consciousnesses 1
great logician dharmakirti whohad special psychic power means could never bedefeated debate much annoyance many non buddhistscould accept eight consciousnesses 1

brief stages path todd fennerpresented america on-line 12/8/95 12/30/95slightly edited first little background: literature stages path abound buddhism 1
might said shakyamunis formula hearing reflecting meditation represents outline well formula discipline meditation wisdom 1
former stages take regarding teaching 1
first hear read etc 1
examine itwith reason experience 1
shakyamuni said simply take teachings respect rather test would test purchase gold 1
finally meditate 1
meditation samadhi 1
means generating particular mind hearing reflection make integral part us power concentration 1
instance hear compassion attended many teachings 1
reflect mentally go differentreasonings beings mothers and/or exchange self compassion dawns us 1
generated mind compassion continually cultivate mind till compassion us always least often 1
refuge renunciation wisdom etc 1
varying degrees concentration 1
general idea 1
latter formula broadly oriented saying essence without discipline conditions meditation/concentration wont arise w/o concentration insight wontdevelop 1
insight intellectual speculation realization 1
however examine mind see even intellectual speculation demands degree mental focus assumes mind isnt undisciplined cant anything flit sense object sense object passion passion 1
theravada master buddhaghosa outlines path purification along latter scheme 1

lineage:the lineage lam rim teachings going post comes largely atisha 982-1055 1
atisha born bengal quite early showed signs prodigy 1
age 21 said mastered many teachings including logic received many empowerments visions hevajra vajra dakini 1
studied avadhutipa direct disciple naropa years 1
period decided become monk age 28 1
traveled studied extensively spent good deal time indonesia 1
became renowned 1
eventually king tibet jangchub od invited come tibet hopes restoring morality many monks tibet 1
atisha founded kadam lineage tibetan buddhism 1
atisha influenced respected lineages tibet 1
work lamp path enlightenment written order answer questions king became basis lam rim tradition 1
key features tradition arethat one final vehiclethat meditation necessary wisdomthat wisdom method critical successthat moral discipline 1
pratimoksa vows established basis bodhisattva vow 1
so-called lower trainings rather replaced higher ones basis higher ones training mahayana vajrayana required resting strong foundation 1
delineated classes persons according capacity motivation 1
initial motivation consisted wished improve lot future livesthose middling motivation sought mere improvement actual liberation samsara advanced motivation sought liberate sentient beings well purpose pursue goal buddhahood 1
lam rim lineage passed kagyu lineage via gampopa1079-1153 wedded lineages atisha notably vast lineage asanga profound lineage nagarjuna blessing lineage milarepa 1
flowing together became dakpo kagyu offshoots including karma drikung dukpa kagyu 1
lama tsongkhapa 1357-1419 fused together many teachings lineages including kadam kagyu sakya plus close lineage received directly manjusri 1
received transmission lam rim nyingma teacher khenchen namkha gyaltsen 1
tsongkhapa wrote extensively lam rim including great middling small expositions 1
addition wrote sngag rim chen mo extensive treatment stages vajrayana path 1
taught-my intent present teachings karma discipline lay people nature samsara impermanence preciousness human rebirth cover first two motivations bodhicitta first five perfections last motivation 1
topic wisdom briefly discussed part discussed previous section view 1
three motivations initial motivation comes desire improve ones lot future life 1
mean better human life life among devas heaven many 1
concerned life classically felt included among dharma motivation 1
classically also religions teach virtue various acts order reborn heaven consideredas belonging class 1
may argued way motivation may dharmas persons belonging higher motivations persons may fact sravakas pratyekas bodhisattvas 1
appears certainly bodhisattvas texts speak possibility arhats pratyekas achieving final goalwhile outwardly appearing practitioner dharmas 1
however beyond scope presentation 1
also beyond scope discuss humanists practice virtue may practice dharmic techniques deny future lives see buddhahood essentially metaphor relatively peaceful one life 1
basic teaching initial motivation karma 1
karma word means action action 1
connotation intent 1
said karma willed action 1
however since primarily applies beings buddhas willed action tainted defilements 1
action take place via body speech mind 1
willed action extremely subtle much difficult notice unless one practiced mindfulness advanced degree 1
likewise defilements mainly three: delusion attachment aversion subtle sense readily appearant unmindful 1
extremely mindful noticeable hair eye 1
unmindful noticeable hair palm callused hand 1
intent involved free choice 1
karma ripens must experience result 1
result karma technically considered karma although word karma ordinary usage includes result 1
buddhism fatalistic 1
school thought india called ajivika completely deterministic 1
tenet buddhism 1
something happens one result karma however one still ability respond ability creates cause either future benefit harm 1
admittedly habit let carried away often chose course action negative results 1
rules virtue discipline intended counteract habit 1
act create cause remains potential conditions ripening potential arise 1
result karma occurs 1
result may occur quickly ages cause 1
may big result little result depending conditions 1
instance seed plant always seed plant conditions growing may non-existent existent poor etc 1
unlikely karma winning lotto ripen without buying lotto ticket 1
said five factors present karmicaction complete assured ripening 1
are:tainted defilementsintentan object intent focusedcarrying intent objecta feeling happy carrying intent 1
example: attachment riches unguarded diamond intent take thediamond taking diamond joy pocket 1
thekarma involving stealing 1
along foregoing line thought drikungpa jigten sumgon argued regard vows wrong think one take upasaka vows killing stealing sexual misconduct lying intoxicants make ok things 1
case would better take vows one could anything impunity 1
vows said meant guard virtue 1
takea vow set dike inhibits us right times protect us 1
full vinaya considered really tight better dike non-virtue upasaka vows 1
bunch rules 1
shakyamuni first taught ordained saying come 1
full vinaya developed incidents occurred shakyamuni guide persons along better way 1
similarly bodhicitta vows protect loss bodhicitta vajrayana vows degeneration ones empowerments blessings 1
karma simple explain isolation actuality gets complex always creating causes 1
mixed usually 1
example given former zong rinpoche lazy generous person reborn american pet; life riley animal nonetheless 1
accumulating wholesome karma minimizing unwholesome one careful mindful 1
reason say four restraints among 37 wings bodhi deal accumulating virtue minimizing ridding non-virtue placed four foundations mindfulness 1
practice mindfulness one recognize wholesome unwholesome act accordingly 1
lists given various abhidharma treatises mental states used practice identify states within one one act accordingly 1
meant excercise metaphysical red tape! 1
said question may arise: method ridding causes already accumulated latent? 1
permanent solution liberation buddhahood 1
however constant practice path one applies four antidotes 1
confession recognition problemregret sincere please! 1
something virtuous taking refuge renewing vows etc 1
wish trouble causing act againthese four act concert allay full result burn seed create unfavorable conditions ripening 1
birth hell may become nightmare instance 1
specific actions also include prostrations reciting confession sutra practice marpa well gelug ngon dro practice; vajrasattva others well included vajrayana 1
however without mind based four antidotes wont much power four antidotes key 1
concludes brief account teaching one initial motivation 1
learned karma one examine implications 1
ones behavior affects ones future ones speech ones thought 1
reason discipline mindfulness critical practices 1
killing leads long life stealing ripped generosity wealth patience beauty concentration meditation puja along virtues rebirth god realms 1
mimamsaka school hinduism believed best one could hope 1
felt vedic rituals rg veda etc 1
saivism etc 1
ensured happy rebirth one continued life life way 1
intermediate motivation generated meditating implications karma long term 1
long run karma never ending losing game 1
one simply cannot avoid suffering misery forever one bound sooner later slip fall fall bad 1
even birth god realms god goddess androgynous viewed favorable even happiness temporary worse god realms one blissed speak one never works build virtue like living ones savings account though starts good eventually runs 1
gods pass away like sentient beings reborn lower realms often hell 1
example: person works hard makes lot money quits spends investment 1
fun lasts money one one street worse one started 1
desire escape whole system begins evolve 1
one comes meditate nature suffering three parts:1 1
suffering suffering2 1
suffering change3 1
pervasive sufferingthe first refers direct acute misery death illness homelessness warhell etc 1
second refers misery results change -- winning gamegaining job starting relationship etc 1
great promise happiness one ecstatic feels top world 1
one acts though winning etc 1
result permanence joy got would happiest person world 1
winning game brings temporary joy; great job becomes job relationships well first kiss doesnt last forever 1
even winningthe lotto becoming world conquering monarch pitfalls 1
third refers capacity things end way always seeking permanent impermanent pure impure self self mine mine 1
view mainly held realized practitioners 1
said everything suffering view meant 1
realized practitioner like reformed addict seeing drink drug reminded misery led rather joy users take 1
case addiction samsara must broken 1
taking pleasure said like licking honey edge razor 1
lamrim viidate: 95-12-16 02:17:53 estfrom: jamyang said sincere seeker individual liberation desires leave samsara fervor one whose hair afire wishes put 1
done basis discipline concentration wisdom 1
discipline must degree one little distraction good conditions contemplation 1
although outlines path vary description general said sravaka principal practice consists development four foundations mindfulness first perhaps serially together concert contemplates dharmas terms sixteen aspects four noble truths 1
sixteen are:* suffering impermanence suffering empty self* origin: arising appearance cause condition* cessation: cessation calm excellent definitive liberation* path: path truth obtaining releasecontemplating one meditates truth two stages consisting development non-fear facility regarding object meditation called patience knowledge certain defilements abandoned called knowledge 1
turn two stages regarding truth contemplated relation objects desire realm objects higher realms realm pure form formless realm 1
thus 16 aspects meditated 16 stages thesixteenth stage generally considered entrance onto path seeing wherein four truths thus seen directly 1
illustrate:suffering -- patience stage desire realm knowledge stage desire realm subsequent patience stage higher realm subsequent knowledge stage higher realmorigin etc 1
abovethe attainment path seeing eliminates certain defilements 1
others must eliminated via path cultivation 1
principle defilements are: attachment anger pride ignorance false view doubt 1
six divided ten subdividing false views belief self false view holding extremes esteeming views esteeming mere ritual ascetic practices 1
ten divided variousmeans including realm relate 1
abhidharmakosa thus counts 98 defilements discusses eliminated seeing cultivation four truths realms 1
full discussion way beyond scope 1
purpose mentioning illustrate necessarily simple slam dunk affair point considered important cultivate wisdom absorption 1
many mahayanists one differentiating points mahayana hinayana meditation sunyata rather sixteen aspects four truths 1
however chandrakirti prasangikas sravakas bodhisattvas cultivate realization sunyata realization even arhats liberated 1
difference lay principally development bodhicitta bodhisattva 1
suchmotivation attended practice perfections enabled deeper cultivation wisdom obstructions omniscience well liberation could eliminated 1
bring point important view asserts meditation wisdom alone cause one otherwise mahayanist fall short slip path arhat 1
thus ends section individual liberation subj 1
lamrim viiidate: 95-12-16 13:06:30 estfrom: jamyang highest motivation grows initial intermediate 1
without first two cannot highest 1
jigten sumgon said famous gong chik vajra verses one intent difference large small vehicle bodhicitta mind intent full enlightenment 1
one argue gong chik saying lot differences vehicles jigten sumgon said really hits nail head differences grow bodhicitta 1
said beings want happy wants suffer 1
things ordinary beings seeking fame gain avoidance loss fear feeding self cherishing mind eventually bring us 1
seeking lasting benefit learn karma conduct accordingly getting benefit lasting 1
realize simply bring permanent benefit seek liberated forever round samsara ocean pain suffering 1
use laws karma end bring conditions useful practice 1
difficult practice god demi-godactually akin greek titans gods usually comfortable titans obsessed gods beaten battle 1
animals large mental capacity practice usually either enslaved caught pure survival 1
ghosts weighed misery envy never happy haveseeing pure water pus blood trying feed enormous appetite never satisfied 1
beings hell experience ripening actions hate control lust greed cant practice much 1
illustration think well practice mind filled anger thoughts getting even etc 1
imagine multiplying many fold get idea flames anger become flames hell 1
even human realm places without dharma places war famine tyrants 1
humans suffer extreme poverty illness etc 1

death could come point miracle breath breath back 1
teacher today could gone tomorrow 1
todays leisure could change tomorrows workload 1
uncertainties chances practice one dharma motivation conduct use karma bring sustain good conditions practice 1
beings seeking individual liberation utilizing merit accumulated practice mindfulness meditate four truths gain wisdom liberates 1
person high motivation likewise uses karma accumulate merit good conditions likewise seeks liberative wisdom motivation high motivation changes seeking liberation oneself maybe others seeking liberation beings 1
recognized four truths describing suffering cessation one considers beings boat 1

beings one time another dearest loved one lover friend child parent 1

see attempts happiness failing 1
beings loved seeking happiness ignorantly may beings hell animal realm enemy 1

lamrim ixdate: 95-12-16 13:34:47 estfrom: jamyang do? 1
one liberate beings? 1
difficult takes much skill skill even arhats 1
arhats may benefit many beings alive succeed liberating many well 1
however death arhat passes state cessation cannot help 1
gifted arhats depth wisdom powers used buddhas even benefit 1
since desire liberate beings everywhere really hoped fulfilled theabilities buddha one vows work toward enlightenment benefit beings 1
said buddha causes beings become liberated beings bodhicitta causes buddhas 1
indeed real cause buddhahood bodhicitta purpose buddhahood liberate benefit beings 1
powers buddhas various forms pure lands retinues etc 1
result vast accumulation merit combined deepening wisdom bodhisattva works deep vast motivation pure selfless love seeking benefit others 1
atisha spite high achievements meditating tantric dieties considered important teacher one taught bodhicitta 1
without bodhicitta best one vajrayana reborn powerful demon 1
emphasis tibetan dharma checking ones motivation 1
buddhahood achieved desire body light retinue emanate countless displays otherwise nifty 1
achieved constant cultivation bodhicitta 1
bodhicitta one work gain necessary accumulations merit wisdom without one wont 1
lamrim xdate: 95-12-16 18:47:16 estfrom: jamyang said three grades bodhisattva motivation 1
shepherd -- wherein like shepherd stays behind flock get pass bodhisattva motivated he/she perfectly willing stay samsara every last liberated matter hardship may result 1
motivation exemplified chenresigavalokitesvara kuan yin 1
ferryperson -- like captain ferry bodhisattva seeks take beings time 1
lets get liberated together 1
king -- like king leads bodhisattva first seeks skill becoming a4 1
buddha leads 1
let get liberated get skill help 1
strongest motivation shepherd however eventually bodhisattvas must act like king motivated simply unless bodhisattva skill one going benefited 1
generation wish enlightenment aspiring bodhicitta act makes one bodhisattva begins path accumulation 1
actual helping beings actual leading beings liberation aiding myriad ways bodhisattva also called engaging bodhicitta 1
engaging bodhicitta said many begin path seeing bodhisattva direct non-conceptualview reality actually begins rid defilements root also teach authoritatively experience 1
path seeing one meditates reality via image 1
image say gelug precise accurate however still image actual experience 1
upon attaining path seeing bodhisattva actually begins practice six perfections 1
called perfections conduct done conjunction knowledge reality comes path seeing onwards 1
thus obstructions omniscience well obstructions liberation eliminated 1
mean perfections practiced beforehand quite contrary must cannot perfected prior path seeing 1
lamrim xidate: 95-12-17 11:35:57 estfrom: jamyang generosity -- first perfectionwhen bodhisattva enters first bhumi great joy enters along 1
seeing true possibility liberation first time longer relying faith inference actual direct knowledge bodhisattvas grasping objects including self becomes mortally wounded 1
practice generosity first bhumi bodhisattva takes principle practice effect accumulating merit wisdom 1
merit act giving wisdom act giving propensity ignorant grasping seeing gift object giving subject giver fundamentally different experiencing loss giving weakened still opposite ignorant grasping developed 1
practice giving divided three reference gift:1 1
material goods2 1
protectionthe bodhisattva practices three according skill means 1
important note perfection practice giving equate actual elimination poverty ignorance fear beings 1
shantideva points outs true none buddhas would perfected since still poverty ignorance fear 1
rather attitude 1
attitude however mere lack miserliness 1
kamalashila argued point view indian buddhism saying giving activistic; consistin actual acts giving via body speech mind 1
true even act primarily mental visualized offerings puja sadhana 1
regard also important note bodhisattvas compassion mere lack intent harm 1
latter something sravaka pratyeka 1
bodhisattva something 1
illustration person fallen pit filled filth 1
passers look andfeel sorrow bodhisattva thinks nothing jumping helping person 1
bodhisattvas acts giving also acts giving like fool 1
giving must done skillfully 1
bodhisattvabhumi asanga actually gets quite detailed proper act giving view givers attitude receiver gift gift 1
rules however distilled one major criteria 1
gift bring true benefit involved? 1
yes suitable 1
lamrim xiidate: 95-12-17 13:20:53 estfrom: jamyang examples suitable non suitable giving? 1
common nowadays would giving gun one intending kill drug addict etc 1
examples non-suitable giving 1
giving benefiting ultimate happiness directly giving food hungry harm ultimate happiness 1
dharma book israre benefiting helping progress ok give someone else gained mastery book 1
different grasping pride fine library 1
people impressed see dedicated dharma student 1
also person asks dharma book teaching suitable person 1
person sincere seeks examine cause trouble etc 1
definitely one give book teaching 1
also even person sincere would harmed receiving particular teaching vajrayana emptiness etc 1
one give 1
shakyamuni knew dispositions persons came like many us expouse everything knew 1
rather teaching customized receiver gain benefit 1
many persons asked sorts teachings shakyamuni refused give would good may actually harm 1
milarepa instance fairly new student suitable vessel dzogchen teachings 1
even though received suchteachings realization developed result 1
go back marpa 1
milarepa even though marpa seemed stingy dharma cruel taskmaster marpas giving dharma mila suitable fitted mila needed 1
many us nowadays dont take account recipient dharma teaching like would recipient material gift 1
hear high teachings blurt place even denigrating low teachings without clue beneficial 1
fact whether teaching superior inferior depend title renown category canon etc 1
depends whether actually benefits depends recipient giver gift 1
shakyamuni brought many path seeing even arhatship use seemingly trivial phrases death happens everybody 1
cases phrase look nature mind allegedly high teaching may useless even harm person result theperson thought kind nonsense this? 1
ill go elsewhere 1
lam rim xiiidate: 95-12-17 13:48:03 estfrom: jamyang last post importance recipient gift might construed wily self cherishing mind excuse stingy 1
even important cultivate mindfulness recognize motivations limitations 1
along way definitely make mistakes big small stop us trying 1
section perfection effort 1
giver: first giving giving 1
giving one thinks get good points giving investment 1
aryadeva chapter catuhsataka says :when one thinks giving gifts nowthere great resultreceiving giving like tradefor profit 1
persons gain prosperity liberation 1
bodhisattva thus cultivates giving without thought reward 1
lama tsongkhapa lists number points judge whether giver practicing correctly 1
incorrect practice postponement causing hardship poorly reneging pledge pointing kind person giving* tiny installments proper give once* lengthy amassing wealth etc 1
correct practice: joy sincerity* respect recipient stupid lazy beggar etc 1
granted difficult start 1
late geshe rabten suggested people one start taking pebble right hand give left vice versa 1
conduct/discipline/morality -- sila paramita 1
rje tsongkhapa explains perfection conduct/morality cultivation attitude non-harming 1
explained previously rules discipline intended guide keeping oneself karmic trouble 1
avoidance ten non-virtues taking lay vows clearly demark line behavior seeks avoid harming others 1
perfection conduct extends even giving offense 1
conduct chapter bodhicaryavatara shantideva criticizes use toothstick improperly well types behavior considered rude 7th centuryindia 1
idea say buddhists adopted ancient indian etiquette 1
rather say conscious rules environment work upset others 1
tsongkhapa points giving measure success actual non-offense everyone since impossible 1
buddhist robe may offend non-buddhist shakyamunis conduct always drove cousin nuts 1
cultivation attitude however behavior ensue minimize harm others serving lessen self grasping negative actions resulting bad migrations 1
giving certain balance needs maintained 1
bodhisattva vows instance demand vinaya rules set aside greater good result 1
however demands mindfulness wisdom 1
one simply take clause bodhisattva vows like loophole irs code 1
shakyamuni previous life took life pirate order save lives 400 persons 1
still resulted short time hell 1
however shakyamuni willing result lovefor beings endure 1
also rudeness coarseness siddhas meant help us result lack mindfulness lets self-grasping run wild 1
excuse us act goofy 1
chetsang rinpoche current head drikung kagyu advised buddhists fit society best could models conduct rather objects ridicule 1
told certain westerners liked run around like tibetan shamans careful scaring people bringing negative view dharma 1
personal view awareness perfection knowledge vinaya bodhisattva vows vajrayana vows etc 1
fit together perfection would go long way protecting teachers students scandals abuses beset sangha 1
teachers monks believe least follow lay vows students aware codes conduct applied 1

chapter patience bodhicaryavatara rather lengthy providing many meditations one event anger arises 1
since book english encourage interested mahayana buy read 1
anger hatred must recognized poisons 1
someone insults let anger arise harm? 1
person cant eat cant sleep starts quarrels loved ones cant enjoy otherwise perfect situation? 1
person insulted you? 1
harmed something need let poison arise something done 1
nothing done poison going help? 1
enemy wants destroy better way try cause anger hatred 1
however arising poison arise solely enemy 1
without cooperation poison cannot arise 1
anger arise important recognize 1
often venting cultivates habit 1
meditations help defuse frame 1
many also think anger necessary accomplish things 1
poison never necessary 1
one perform actions even assertive fierce ones without emotion 1

energy overcomes obstacles patience directed 1
directed harming unable bear study etc 1
sometimes fine distinction isimportant keeping one going extremes 1
bodhisattva must bear many things seems 1
however regular reacting according emotional habit simply keeps wheel samsara going 1
bodhisattva must break away habit 1
looking upon miserliness reactive conduct anger enemies keep us bound bodhisattva seeks reverse habits 1
sravaka well bodhisattva seeking welfare others must try even thereis chances encountering obstacles 1
bodhisattva fearing result cause opposite ordinary beings confronted something unpleasant thinks old reactions anger etc 1
among many meditations bodhisattva looking upon bad situations opportunity accumulate merit 1
reacting anger something agitates results negative karma 1
reacting forbearance accumulates merit results calm loving mind long life beauty etc 1

perfection cannot emphasized enough 1
buddhism effort liberation enlightenment gained 1
buddha though skillful cannot help unless put forth effort 1
story lama gained power remember past lives 1
one day seated image buddha said remembered long ago buddha shakyamuni neighbors fact much wealthier 1
lama went say big difference future shakyamuni put forth effort waste time diddled around 1
drikungpa jigten sumgon said effort important perfection effort dharma accomplished without nothing could 1
speaking sutra tantra said even sutra path could accomplished one life enough effort put 1

armor like2 1
non-satisfactionthe first courage stick path enlightenment matter hardship comes 1
second letting setbacks disappointments cripple one 1
teacher geshe lhundup sopa told expect fail fall along path 1
difference success depends ability pick oneself 1
application refers practicing dharma mind delight joy 1

one problems practice best advice get back basics turn means regenerating ones motivation enlightenment 1
reviewing one needs steps refuge renunciation striving others rote way genuine way 1

lamrim xixdate: 95-12-27 23:38:35 estfrom: jamyang important part effort also following right path 1
mean path right 1

right path means path brings benefit 1
finding right teacher takes even 1
particularly vajrayana teacher important one pick lightly testing 1
dalai lama says lot testing 1
ones teacher may famous high title 1
two things necessary qualified teacher qualified student 1

questioning good right 1
buddhism rulesof conduct apply teacher well student 1
using common sense things like go long way avoid trouble 1
also whether path quick slow depends student path 1
many so-called higher teachings result abandonment path dharma much less merely create obstacles 1
case student may progress quicker first introduced truths rather mahamudra 1
also remember shakyamuni brought many path seeing even arhantship seemingly trivial statements everybody dies dzogchen teachings milarepa got resulted delay enlightenment 1
reason one never disparage buddhas teachings low meant dummies 1
doesnt mean go extreme practicing higher practices either 1

lamrim xxdate: 95-12-28 11:45:07 estfrom: jamyang concentrationwhen shakyamuni left palace went various famous teachers seeking key liberation learned concentration meditation rarefied levels 1
key liberation however 1
insight fueled concentrations power proved key 1
nonetheless concentration seen important tool indeed except schools nearly indispensable 1
reason simple 1
order generate true insight generate concentration normal state prone either flit object object passions arise fall asleep passions arise simply stable enough achieve even deep conceptual view insight much less direct view 1
thus concentration meditation insight meditation need go hand hand 1
asanga defining meditation says focusing virtuous single area thought mundane orsupramundane preceded hearing examining 1
true whether focus category concentration insight two together 1
achievement concentration/calm abiding shamatha samadhi done striking balance mind scattering sinking focusing object thought mental object one remain concentrated indefinite time one achieves strong degree mental suppleness takes little effort 1
last important one able control one go another object meditation leave state ones business without disruption 1
heard practiced watching breath become quite adept claim achieved calm abiding 1
however asked substitute lets say guru tree breath cant 1
considered calm abiding lack factorof mental suppleness 1
briefly stated: scattering tendency mind flit object object uncontrollably sinking dullness lack energy eventually causes loss object via sleep 1
usually scattering bigger problem beginning sinking end 1
sinking particularly insidious mimics one pointedness generate pleasant sensation 1
however mimics one pointedness dulland *cant* move pleasant sensation akin resting 1
lamrim xxidate: 95-12-28 23:28:04 estfrom: jamyang formal teaching shamatha tibetan buddhism often covers nine different stages abiding first directing mind object bringing back distraction able counteract sinking able one pointed indefinitely calm abiding marked incredible suppleness bliss clarity 1
teachings one taught different characteristics stage different techniques used foradvancement may needlessly complex post 1

presence investigation examination lama tsongkhapa recommends dhyana cultivation insight analysis 1
second dhyana joy bliss one-pointedness 1
third bliss one-pointedness* fourth pure one-pointedness 1
difference investigation examination joy andbliss difference approach 1

four formless dhyanas well 1
first attained object eliminated one meditates space occupied 1
second one meditates consciousness cognizing space 1
third even gone nothing all* fourth even nothing neither perception non-perception 1
last called pinnacle world 1
important remember rarefied formless states definitely goal generally avoided 1
strong cultivation states without accomplishing path seeing canresult rebirth trance state lasting eons nothing accomplished whatsoever 1
remembering names characteristics states helps understand trepidation many teachers teachings emphasize nothingness consciousness space etc 1
terms applied emptiness meditation dzogchen mahamudra etc 1
mean altogether different things easy fall formless trap trap 1
lamrim xxiiidate: 95-12-29 16:45:48 estfrom: jamyang one join analytic meditation concentration? 1
essentially one analyzes power concentration 1
lama tsongkhapa argues vigorously lam rim chen mo one use reason analyze first absorption 1
absorption need state wherein nothing happens 1
sometimes training thoughts discouraged 1
sometimes one cuts 1
sometimes one lets arise pass away without cultivation 1
however union analysis concentration one must analyze 1
degree analysis varies 1
methods one simply notices happening 1
theravada methods one notices arising passing away dharmas awareness discovers impermanence self 1
mahamudra focused mind one searches nature mind asking color shape etc 1
one something similar mind section ofdzogchen 1
using madhyamika techniques reason one uses either syllogisms orconsequences reasoning one many 1
gelug following:* ascertainment way ordinary self conceived 1
stabilizing idea* using consequences explore idea something truly established 1
gelug say one going get rid mistaken notion negate one must sort idea mistaken notion 1
notion negatee 1
one purposely generates situation mind self arises clearly 1
may include remembering someone insulting one incident one praised 1
gelug notion much analysis notion inherent independent existence 1
whenthe notion successfully negated negated way nothing replaces 1
called non affirming negation 1
affirming negation one another idea arises place object negated 1
instance: fat devadatta eat day implies devadatta eating night 1
hand: brahmans dont drink beer imply anything dont drink 1
gelug type negation essential avoid reifying emptiness 1
instance negating defilement one might replace purity think pure mind truly established 1
worrisome however one might think nothingness truly established come conclusion practice thinking taken literally meant 1
method gelug use slightly different simple search self among aggregates true nature mind gelug active setting notion self first 1
boils method rather view 1
self negated one generated conceptual image emptiness one uses increased strength focused concentration burn away image realize emptiness directly 1
method based partly epistemological theories dignaga dharmakirti 1
according one knows something via direct perception inference yogic direct perception 1
first happened first moment asense consciousness perceiving something 1
second used ascertain hidden former 1
inference formal even discursive rather automatic 1
case regular direct perception everything presented consciousness including true nature impermanent self etc 1
however usually ascertained 1
second true nature may ascertained indirectly via image 1
image meant concept 1
third categorythat yogic direct perception one perceives ascertains fully without benefit image 1
sorts nuances basically 1

ends brief discourse lam rim exception wordson vajrayana next post 1
vajrayana path considered subset mahayana 1
foundations renunciation bodhicitta key prerequisites 1
addition knowledge emptiness also required 1
emptiness sutrayana vajrayana methods differ 1
vajrayana utilizes method bringing result onto path 1
practical effect bringing practice deity yoga 1
question whether first tantra set kriya deity yoga however general kriya texts susiddhi tantra says 1
numerous little issues concerning exact definitions tantra divisions therein however brief tantra defined 1
many persons idea offerings visualizing dieties saying mantras etc 1
unique vajrayana 1
practiced sutrayana well 1
general self generation deity unique tantra requires empowerment 1
divisions tantra sets arranged according degree internalness practice subtlety consciousness utilized 1
although cannot vows disclose specific practices indeed go much beyond already said want clarify certain point 1
many think sutra dumped one practices vajrayana 1
much vajrayana assumes knowledge gained sutras 1
vajrayana additive doesnt replace 1
risk disclosing much also say even abhidharma categories 37 wing enlightenment skandhas etc 1
play important parts tantric meditation 1
consequently one wants meditation simply recite sadhana one devote time sutras shastras 1
without far much seems arbitrary mere poetics tantric practice 1
personally believe current trend studying going empowerments blessings bring degeneration tantra something like happened christian eucharist/mass 1
precious bodhicitta hasnt arisen may arise 1
arisen may decline grow ever fuller 1
virtue writing reading teaching may beings brought tothe state vajradhara may dharma take solid root west may obstacles arise itspractice flourishing 1

let us relate withhis story way 1
hang-ups naropa experienced allhis imaginations visual mind auditory mind heexperienced part makeup well 1
arepossibilities stepping confusion 1
student: confused things naropa asked todo 1
seemingly shouldnt contradiction agurus teaching buddhas teaching 1
yet visionsthere seem lot 1
example asking killlice seems direct contradiction 1
one hand his"sane" sensible mind saying "dont this"; otherit saying "do 1
seems either way poor guy turnshe gets cut 1
would happened killed thelice? 1
still would violation speak 1
trungpa rinpoche: probably moment thingas lice killed 1
physically may lice atall 1
s: still youre killing whether projection 1
kill somebody dream isnt actuallycarrying action? 1
tr: quite different 1
youre dealing ownprojections dream 1
dreamed became amillionaire wouldnt actually become millionaire 1
s: still sounds suicidal 1
even lice arent theresomething exists 1
tr: yes something exists projections dogmayour resistance killed 1
course issomething there; something *the* thing 1
s: killed youre still left killer arent you? 1
tr: attaining enlightenment could described killing ego 1
s: sounds suicidal hence complete 1
tr: complete 1
attain enlightenment killer ofego efficient precise ego cannot arise atall even memory 1
fine job 1
wekill somebody literal sense cannot kill themcompletely 1
cant kill name cant kill theirrelatives something left 1
killing ego connectionwith attainment enlightenment complete job thename concept killed well 1
s: sometimes talk meditation terms making friendswith 1
call making friends withyourself? 1
tr: self? 1
s: doesnt seem friendly 1
tr: act friend act compassion 1
ego ismurdered compassion love 1
usually murder takesplace hate 1
murder ego doneout compassion quite surprisingly complete 1
themurder ego complete murder contrast otherkind 1
s: putting misery 1
tr: quite 1
respecting misery 1
student: rinpoche sounds though youre saying togo beyond transcend ego even right getinto tantra 1
trungpa rinpoche: go beyond? 1
think yes 1
seemsthat current situation america stage ofbeing haunted lady thirty-seven ugly marks asnaropa 1
havent developed next stages naropassearch tilopa yet 1
stayed thebeginning 1
moment seem discovering thedifference words sense 1
discovery theword seems sense quite case 1
discovering words naropa reading thatparticular book back sun 1
reading book onlogic 1
seem level 1
long way go 1
student: one situations naropa goes througha step developing confusion? 1
trungpa rinpoche: situation different symbolismrelated yes 1
student: arranging visions? 1
trungpa rinpoche: nobody 1
seems happen way 1
student: rinpoche could say madness ofinsanity talking about? 1
trungpa rinpoche: madness beyond conceptualized pointof view ego 1
example outrageous state ofhatred trying relate somebody object thathatred person doesnt communicate back termsof hate might think mad person 1
think madbecause doesnt fight back 1
far concernedthat person mad lost perspective ofaggression passion point view 1
s: point view samsara? 1
tr: yes 1
point view samsara buddha mad 1
theres story indian scriptures particularcountry soothsayer predicted king would beseven days rain containing substance would make peoplemad 1
whoever drank water would go mad 1
whole kingdomwas going go mad 1
hearing prediction king collectedgallons gallons water private use keep himselffrom going mad 1
rain fell everyone else went mad 1
began accusing king mad 1
finally hegave decided drink water madness order fitin rest kingdom 1
couldnt bothered keepinghimself "insane 1
"student: different visions naropa doesntwant things hes asked presumably hethinks theyre immoral 1
conclude thatmorality moral law purely something operates inthe ego realm enlightened person position oftilopa follows moral law? 1
trungpa rinpoche: tilopa follow moral law itsabsolute perfection 1
s: mean? 1
tr: conventional moral law purely relatingwith conscience rather dealing situations 1
dealingwith situations right wrong insituations tilopas fashion 1
relate situationin terms conscience perceptions means youdont even idea understanding situation 1
thisseems happens general life 1
try tounderstand situations precisely possible aresituations regard bad understand 1
example ifyou investigate murder case might want todissociate case altogether thinking "i dontwant involved murder 1
way atall understanding one person murdered 1
could let become involved murder case andtry understand rightness wrongness done asscientifically possible 1
could look situation interms cause effect gain understanding 1
buton hand think "becoming involved murderwill get contact bad vibrations ill havenothing that" seal completely 1
exactly thing seems happening inpresent-day society 1
particularly young generation doesntwant anything society let alone understandit something ugly something terrible 1
thiscreates tremendous confusion conflict 1
whereas people wereto get society try understand wrong theremight intelligence coming 1
complete rejectionwithout discrimination seems problem 1
student: register vote? 1
trungpa rinpoche: not? 1
add energies countrys 1
student: dont think things weve alllearned rejection talking about? 1
trungpa rinpoche: yes 1
lot people haverejected christianity gone hinduism buddhism 1
feelthat longer associations christianity atall 1
later point view aliens beginto realize christianity speaks kind profound truth 1
see point view aliens goneaway 1
begin appreciate culture brought upin 1
finally become best christians people muchmore understanding christianity ordinary christians 1
cant reject history 1
cant say hair isblack blond 1
accept history 1
thosewanting imitate oriental culture might go far become100 percent hindu 100 percent japanese even point ofundergoing plastic surgery 1
somehow denying existence -your body makeup psychological approach nothelp 1
fact brings problems 1
relate country politics itsculture 1
extremely important since cannot becomesomeone else 1
could become someone else halfway someone else thatwould provide us tremendous number sidetracks andpossibilities escape 1
thankful abody culture race country honestly andwe relate 1
cant reject 1
thatrepresents relationship earth whole nationalkarma rest 1
seems startingpoint attaining enlightenment becoming buddha americanbuddha 1
student: rinpoche naropas experiences seem symbols 1
cant go far taking everything symbol? 1
weprevent going far sense? 1
trungpa rinpoche: naropa sense failed way hedidnt chance relating tilopa immediately 1
forthat reason got much involved symbolism 1
samecould apply us well 1
much matter muchsymbolism much fascination context 1

continued existence buddhadharma depends upon continued existence sangha— community ordained practitioners monks nuns— one three buddhist refuges 1
talks lama yeshe lama zopa rinpoche explain great benefits practicing dharma ordained person keep ordination pure purpose monastic community live together monks nuns much 1
necessity lay community support sangha also made clear monks nuns lay practitioners gain much reading book 1
thank ven 1

editorial suggestions ven 1
connie miller rand engel wendy cook greatly improved readability talks 1
finally grateful jennifer martin garrett brown help design production book 1
may sangha flourish ten directions benefit sentient beings 1
first talk lama yeshe around time fifth kopan meditation course november 1973 ten western dharma students asked lama yeshes permission get ordained 1
lama suggested take ordinations following january bodhgaya holiness dalai lama given kalachakra initiation 1
december 1973 lama gathered room ten prospective monks nuns together five six students already ordained offered following advice 1
first talk lama ever gave sangha community 1
today want express feelings sisters brothers seeing remarkable revolutionary explosion energy 1
internal revolution external one 1
given lot think good feeling well 1
feel kind intuitive responsibility decision youve made live dharma ive thought lot integrate lives dharma continue experience internal revolutionary energy without interruption develop minds unlimited potential 1
feeling would much better sangha stay together communicating rather people getting ordained going 1
go worldly conditions make life difficult; much harder practice dharma 1
example sangha kopan help lead monastic life 1
always lamas present result students get kind energy helps control minds easy keep ordination 1
instead run stay place good conditions lives become difficult 1
top get sick coming together internal external problems makes lives even difficult 1
know youre monk nun mean youve reached enlightenment 1
simply means gained understanding nature samsara decided work continuously develop within everlasting peaceful path liberation 1
getting ordained doesnt give immediate control mind; doesnt mean completely liberated 1
minds uncontrolled 1
need control 1
monastic life allows us develop minds comfortable way truly achieved complete control gained great knowledge-wisdom even go berserk place able control berserk energy instead controlling us 1
us beginners desire attain everlasting peaceful liberation like flower seed 1
flower seed needs cared watered kept warm fertilized— many things necessary 1
water alone enough needs fertilizer 1
similarly need dharma teachings 1
get teachings retreat wake fantastically; enthusiastic energy always comes 1
otherwise like flowers given drops water; problems arise find difficult deal 1
minds like flowers; take good care 1
tibet lay people looked sangha 1
great respect sangha knew despite experiencing difficult conditions sangha duty 1
"difficult conditions" dont mean people beating 1
deluded minds beat them; deluded minds didnt like fighting wisdom 1
lay people knew sangha life difficult worthwhile respected sanghas internal knowledge control 1
therefore sangha much support tibet 1
us like that; take responsibility 1
wherever western sangha live even india nepal different west 1
mean eat western food— cant live like indians nepalis 1
therefore need somehow put western lifestyle dharma together 1
need coffee; coffee 1
need sweet tea sweet tea; need medicine take medicine; need cake maybe eat cake! 1
certain habits particular heritage bodies raised certain way 1
cant tell eat tsampa drink tibetan tea thats 1
cannot force like 1
dont need external changes; dont need focused cutting various kinds food giving things youre used 1
really necessary 1
important provide body used needs stay healthy 1
thats important "oh im renunciate— renounce give 1
renunciation mind physical level 1
"i want give wallet! 1
please somebody take it! 1
makes things difficult dear 1
think people understand 1
mentioned feel whats happening remarkable ive thinking thinking remarkable energy keep going 1
worry little… well say worry dont mean im suffering 1
perhaps concern better word— im concerned 1
therefore think need rules 1
course 36 precepts addition rules: government rules monastery rules meditation course rules 1
example course get certain time meals certain times 1
rules contained 36 precepts they? 1
still necessary living certain situation 1
make kinds rules dont we? 1
cant reject them: "who made rules? 1
get 5: 30 morning coffee? 1
lord buddha never said 1
well doesnt matter whether lord buddha said words not; rules necessary communal way life 1
introduce kind small discipline creating sangha community 1
example become monk nun youre allowed stay situations samsaric places theres lot dancing drinking 1
dangerous frequent places 1
bringing deluded mind samsaric places like bringing piece paper close fire 1
[here lama brings piece paper closer closer candle table bursts flames 1
youre okay distance get close fire youll get burned 1
flammable materials kept away fire beginners stay away dangerous situations 1
said become monk nun doesnt mean liberated enlightened 1
simply means decided act way eventually reach perfect control liberation freedom— many words doesnt matter use 1
somehow searching 1
get ordained understand theres better way finding joy life 1
make kinds rules sangha 1
take bouddhanath example 1
bouddhanath holy place many people especially nepalese tibetans also consider drinking place place men women get together fun 1
make chang [tibetan beer] 1
dont really know true people say 1
probably places like kathmandu well 1
actually people know better 1
try explain samsara youre probably thinking "whats lama talking about? 1
describe much better 1
im joking! 1
anyway monk stays kind place sangha friends say "dear living terrible situation? 1
know youre allowed stay 1
wouldnt better came stayed quieter place? 1
since sangha surely youd better monastery 1
sangha leave go home remain keep touch even theyre away still feel close dharma brothers sisters 1
otherwise might start thinking "oh im alone whatever like 1
gurus sangha community im back country im free 1
feel possibility happening cant you? 1
im negative; possibility dear okay? 1
therefore need develop strong togetherness energy instead allowing sangha split go way 1
think create community specifically western sangha 1
dont think im talking 15 room 1
imagine whats going happen 1
many sangha; next meditation course 1
next one 1
time might become 100 000 strong! 1
mean dharma wisdom isnt it? 1
therefore need somehow develop strong togetherness way well able practice dharma easily without overwhelmed agitated worldly conditions 1
simple example: sangha come kopan 1
dont good conditions feel uncomfortable leave feeling negative thinking "its possible stay monastery 1
ill find home lead samsaric life 1
minds react tiny causes 1
therefore discuss face world integrate dharma way life 1
monks nuns difficulty keeping physical lives together ever get chance study retreat? 1
strength sangha community ensures everybody chance take teachings retreat; makes sure everybody okay minimizes external conditions cause one lose mental discipline 1
think really worthwhile 1
helps lot 1
theres sangha vibration see; look theres vibration automatically helps control energy 1
stay place everybody drinking first kind intellectualize "theyre like that; im like 1
might okay im talking happens intellectual level 1
subconsciously level intuitive feeling something else going sooner later poof! 1
paper catches fire gets close flame get completely caught whatevers going around 1
always say mind like mirror 1
automatically reflects whatever front 1
intellectually mind saying "oh thats samsara" whatever come contact leaves imprint mind 1
day comes youre little bit tired little bit thirsty little drink— little little drink 1
"hmmm good 1
little thirsty little drink 1
harm done 1
thats start 1
know children candy 1
eat one "wow! 1
want more… more… more… more… like 1
well people know 1
im giving example 1
know mind works kind situation well 1
conditions put important 1
lay peoples way life sangha way life different 1
discriminate somehow shouldnt you? 1
im pointing negatively "oh thats bad 1
lay peoples lifestyle trip way life something else; way life 36 precepts 1
dont youre better crazy person 1
crazy people cant tell difference good bad 1
able make distinction 1
example butchers job kill job different isnt it? 1
butchers way life sangha way life different shouldnt they? 1
someone accuses discriminating im going say "yes! 1
im discriminating 1
long havent transcended discrimination discriminate 1
course argue words many different ways ultimately words dont mean anything 1
need discriminating wisdom 1
anyway opinion feeling 1
nobody told tell this; ego game 1
felt since dharma understanding led conclusion want get ordained express feelings way things developing 1
western people arent stupid; check see 1
western monks nuns good attitude behave well develop strong sangha community group togetherness western people respect 1
theyll feel westerners becoming sangha worthwhile 1
might even want help 1
conclusion choose way life irrespective people country society 1
look things wisdom; check 1
example come kopan create conditions 1
nothing nepalese government 1
dont tell us 1
make sure teachings make sure everybody okay make sure work together achieve aims 1
accordingly create world 1
right conditions becomes easy us want 1
ive expressed feelings discuss amongst create strong sangha togetherness 1
dont think im attached keeping kopan 1
dont think im hung 1
doesnt matter live long maintain strong sangha togetherness 1
create kinds conditions 1
think wisdom strong 1
advantages monastic life: lama yeshe 1982 lama yeshe organized first enlightened experience celebration five-month series teachings initiations retreats held bodhgaya dharamsala india 1
100 international mahayana institute monks nuns attended 1
dharamsala part program lama yeshe called monks nuns gompa tushita retreat centre two successive evenings april 17 18 gave following talks 1
want say words western monks nuns gathered today 1
somehow fortunate 1
trying live according lord buddhas vinaya rules best even day month extremely fortunate 1
good enough 1
days world degenerating rapidly impurity aggression grasping resources leading people state tremendous anxiety 1
though monks nuns cannot ignore happening world 1
newspapers magazines full information; even far mountains still feel negative vibration 1
therefore good reason proud ordination 1
proud rather think "im monk-im useless lonely" "im nun-im useless lonely 1
instead repeating mantra feel proud 1
also im satisfied way dharma celebration holding gone 1
consider 20th century westerners living simply grasp sense pleasures like dream 100 western monks nuns come together event like 1
remember holiness ling rinpoche told us bodhgaya although tourists going long time gathering historic occasion; never westerners come together live practice according buddhist way life 1
living purely vinaya rules even day rare; good enough 1
imi started id like recount little history international mahayana institute 1
people doubts called organization "international mahayana institute": didnt like name 1
dont care! 1
cares whether like others dont-thats dualistic mind work 1
without object hatred theres desire 1
came name words mean something 1
members sangha come world truly international; buddhism practice mahayana; since educational phenomenon called institute: international mahayana institute 1
form institute? 1
shouldnt international monks nuns go mountains live like milarepa? 1
need organization? 1
well take dharma celebration example: many people take organize it? 1
without organization could enlightened experience celebration happened? 1
thats answer 1
even two people living together couple need organize lives 1
need organization 1
hippies reject organization-that stupid; dont understand 1
cant organize even lives let alone something benefits many others 1
create institute? 1
felt according vinaya rules responsibility 1
sangha members started dharma studies lam-rim; gave understanding nature samsara benefits renunciation best way practice 1
experience enthusiastic getting ordained 1
said yes 1
know say yes easy; ordain anybody day reciting words ordination ceremony "blah blah blah 1
ordaining someone days work 1
lord buddha said take care sangha 1
take care sangha? 1
im stupid himalayan monk neither worldly organizational experience 1
never even manager sera monastery 1
simple monk 1
study serve cook teacher 1
checked needed done appeared difficult take responsibility become almost 100 monks nuns 1
process led conclude created sangha community organization members would help 1
need security 1
tibetans call "white crows 1
tibetans consider westerners becoming monks nuns impossible crows white 1
far society concerned outcasts 1
pink faces show part tibetan society renounced attitude outcasts western society well 1
think hare krishnas 1
im putting hare krishnas people reject us thats think 1
felt needed security creating category could exercise reality 1
therefore eight years ago formed organization 1
since weve growing five ten monks nuns every year 1
originally established organization kathmandu kopan view monks nuns stayed successful 1
studied lam-rim learned rituals 1
time government changed visa laws became impossibly expensive stay 1
thought well thats okay; big deal 1
westerners nepalis; would stupid think spending entire lives nepal third world 1
still renounced comfort life good thing 1
thought deeply 1
took long time establish nalanda first western monastery 1
wasnt easy 1
west get involved dollars 1
without money cant buy land 1
fortunately one devoted student offered us property lavaur finally place offers us opportunity lead monastic life take care 1
renounced comfort certain extent still problems; yet eliminated three poisons 1
buddhas; arhats 1
need take care emotionally 1
difficult lay people us 1
monks cry lay people dont understand: "this monk supposed renounced samsara hes crying it? 1
monks nuns understand comfort warm other: "oh dont cry 1
yes todays little cloudy clear tomorrow 1
many differences lay people ordained 1
lifestyles different; thinking different; responsibilities different 1
older monks nuns dedicated organizing food clothing shelter transport nepal india retreat teaching facilities order keep sangha community together 1
newer monks nuns cant appreciate hard worked; old ones know 1
tried best; long history 1
reached certain point many us without income almost impossible go 1
still tried take care everybody 1
sangha money shared others 1
happy see 1
days scattered world; dont home economically difficult share limited resources help 1
future nalanda monastery firmly established hope everybody share order help 1
cannot organize 1
vision needs done cant take needle thread sew robes myself; cannot everyday tasks 1
people need get organized help 1
see monks nuns need education 1
offer good education dont get organized? 1
see difficult 1
anyway thats short history started 1
means monk nun lets talk beginning become monk nun means monk nun 1
permitting westerners become monks nuns job take lightly 1
good ordain people easily 1
learned lot experience past eight years 1
first parents still guardians good relationship need permission become monk nun 1
happy decision 1
important; weve experience 1
people got ordained without parents permission later negative mind arose 1
know negative mind ego always likes rationalize-" well mother never really liked ordained think id better give back robes sake 1
ive experience 1
say "okay good 1
really want keep ordination cares samsaric mother thinks? 1
samsaric mother stupid too; full ignorance full desire full hatred 1
lord buddha said strong weak need parents permission totally convinced right dont 1
tell parents stupid 1
call country birth "the nest samsara 1
look situation 1
lived tibet uncle took care 1
parents mean well giving food clothes money samsaric mind worrying reputation-im sorry sufficient 1
saying strong enough dont need parents permission 1
shakyamuni buddha good example 1
gave permission leave home leave kingdom? 1
hundreds wives grasping him; theres way would given permission go lead ascetic life 1
many westerners want become monks nuns simply "i hate society; hate parents way life-theres alternative 1
anyway seems monks nuns easy life think ill get ordained 1
lord buddha said wrong become monk nun simplify life sense dont worry getting food clothing worry husband wife 1
connotation pratimoksha 1
prati means individual; moksha means liberation nirvana 1
implies understand personal samsaric situation feel dissatisfied external object society 1
understanding really touches heart become monk nun basis ordination truly renounced one 1
tell become monk nun bad motivation never succeed 1
correct motivation important thing 1
get ordained? 1
way get ordained though good old enough decide 1
westerners becoming monks nuns age 20 better way tibetans 1
stupid six-year-old boy decided become monk 1
smart; lost chance enjoy many lifes experiences! 1
seen sense world youve enough male-female relationships youve experienced worldly life offer youve reached certain point think "i want make life easy-going instead always conflict hurting others human relationships 1
actually better dharma way getting ordained 1
tibetan way sometimes culturally determined 1
course tibetan culture good aspects bad; cant say tibetan culture good 1
also develops samsaric egotistical mind 1
therefore responsibility preceptor-lama geshe yogi yogini whoever is-to ensure heart right motivation getting ordained 1
sometimes people driven neurotic emotional feelings: "oh lam-rim says renunciation best way practice! 1
hey lets go! 1
want like milarepa! 1
often happened tibet 1
common-many us like 1
example monks colleges would go hear high lama teach lam-rim would explain fantastic milarepa lama tsong khapa renounced world 1
many would run college go mountains lead ascetic lives 1
course days would come back down! 1
thats emotional 1
westerners get excited: "oh becoming monk becoming nun good idea! 1
becoming monk nun good idea! 1
actually life monk nun quite difficult 1
lay people compassion us! 1
tibetan lay people compassion sangha least used to– im sure still 1
perhaps days given monks nuns 1
anyway emotional feeling enough 1
pratimoksha means renounced ordination 1
renunciation means somehow strength really comprehend worldly pleasures whatever 1
feel something totally incompatible sangha behavior actually wonderful life monk nun difficult indeed 1
however good understanding universal samsaric situation true renunciation come easily 1
therefore getting ordained receive perfect detailed explanations nature samsara liberation renunciation really means 1
attitude makes big difference-a big difference 1
renounced attitude superstitious tendencies somehow dispelled 1
psychologically expectations makes difference 1
sometimes tell people wanting get ordained wait couple years 1
think good 1
live monk nun see ordaining 1
people criticized do? 1
think important people live monks nuns couple years without carrying heavy burden ordination 1
done two years still wanted become monks nuns 1
also told people renounce worldly life wear robes live sangha 1
tibetan call nyam-par nam-sum: live monk nun listen abbots advice dont behave loosely like lay people do– three 1
easy; three simple conditions 1
live like reach point sure way want live rest life 1
take actual 36 novice vows 1
easy way develop good understanding like ordained: theres pressure nothing lose flexible 1
think good idea 1
summary one become monk nun easily 1
become ordained important receive detailed explanation vows 1
relationship abbot relationship abbot? 1
according vinaya person ordains becomes abbot 1
becomes responsible way father responsible welfare daughter son; kind relationship 1
remember explained ordained? 1
important; joke 1
said giving ordination easy: "blah blah blah 1
okay youre monk nun goodbye! 1
one hour 1
thats easy 1
lord buddha said "no! 1
maintain strong relationship abbot 1
whatever important question comes want ask right wrong 1
way take care 1
days somehow difficult 20th century monks nuns sustain strong relationship abbots 1
split parents split gurus split abbot 1
kind revolutionary lifestyle 1
older monks however know close vinaya abbot great significance really means something important 1
dont think "im individualist like 1
yes whatever like 1
nobodys pushing make commitment choose lifestyle certain goals need many interdependent phenomena develop direction help reach point 1
western lifestyle gives much freedom also encourages develop strong individualistic ego 1
generally whatever ego tells 1
dont ego says feel frustrated 1
change attitude 1
get ordained trust abbot give energy guide help 1
confidence abbot wont give bad advice lead disastrous situation 1
therefore build good connection abbot based right understanding help liberated 1
let strong individualistic ego rule you; instead develop good relationship teacher dharma brothers sisters 1
resources dharma wisdom grows 1
youve ordained ordination must act according vinaya rules much possibly 1
getting ordained easy; takes less day 1
difficulty lies keeping going; thats hardships 1
need study vinaya rules detail 1
example may remember act killing four branches: motivation object action completion 1
completely break vow killing four branches need involved 1
even something breaks vow one four aspects missing action completely negative; vow partially broken 1
important know things 1
many times westerners cry theyve lost ordination 1
check havent lost 1
may broken something— experience— may broken vow small way broken completely 1
vows broken degrees 1
study things clean-clear-then know keep ordination 1
since beginners sometimes break vows theres way confess breaks 1
also degrees confession different ways confessing 1
usually conduct formal confession ceremonies [so-jong] twice month 1
good attend 1
participating so-jong enough purify great accumulation negativity broken precepts 1
vinaya rules change remember vinaya rules change times 1
culture changes vinaya rules also change 1
lord buddha said 1
study vinaya detail 1
doesnt mean days kill– doesnt mean 1
example western womens use perfume commonplace; nothing special big deal 1
tibet third world countries woman puts perfume something special– people think theres something going mind 1
west nothing: men women use perfume 1
almost obligatory! 1
take account cultural differences 1
reinforcing ordination meditation understand vows deeply able enumerate 1
opinion keeping vows monastery east easy 1
west even knowing intellectually clean-clear details vows enough 1
westerners need reinforce intellectual understanding meditation; otherwise impossible keep ordination 1
environment overwhelming 1
telling "do that; dont youre stupid 1
dont grasp coca-cola youre stupid 1
im exaggerating little impact influences strong strong 1
really feel grateful westerners trying keep ordinations pure 1
live west strong inside 1
otherwise possible 1
west people think youre almost criminal youre ordained: "the man next door strange; lives alone wife children 1
must sick 1
popular understanding reality culture 1
result westerners need expend tremendous energy keep ordinations 1
life west easy 1
thats easy job tibetan monks go west either 1
course centers world live one almost like living monastery 1
thats different 1
small world may able preserve ordination 1
gets difficult go center 1
therefore monks nuns put much energy meditating every day 1
generate internal satisfaction enable avoid stress breaking vows 1
without meditation possible 1
creating conducive environment ones environment must conducive 1
put lot energy protecting monks nuns helping keep ordination 1
centers try create separate quarters sangha 1
tried many different ways far often economically feasible 1
creation nalanda monastery hope well able live monastic life desire thereby able develop internal world quickly 1
really strongly advise live monastic life much possibly internal strength withstand pressures outside world 1
otherwise difficult 1
remember vasubandhu said abhidharmakosha? 1
one factors causes delusions explode within object: object makes deluded 1
mind like mirror-it reflects objects superstitions produced delusions arise resulting deluded actions 1
therefore environment important 1
would benefit majority others live monastic life 1
give priority that; worthwhile 1
course different skills-some people certain things others cant-so exceptions 1
example may able lead ascetic life retreat; would exception 1
least monks nuns receive basic education; words teachings lam-rim 1
without lam-rim monks nuns disasters 1
need practice lam-rim meditation order grow 1
however west people intellectual knowing lam-rim alone may enough 1
also need understand philosophical basis dharma knowledge order prove points reasoning logic 1
monastic rules besides following vinaya rules must also observe internal rules monastery 1
related vinaya vows 1
example dont attend morning puja breaking vow still breaking sangha community rule good 1
sick lung exception made 1
go gekö explain well ask permission skip puja 1
lord buddha always took care sick; thats exception 1
dont lung physical illness participating bad bad 1
actually tell means haveno compassion 1
look thangkas call rig-sum gom-po [avalokiteshvara manjushri vajrapani]: sometimes avalokiteshvara center like servants disciples manjushri vajrapani 1
representations youll see manjushri vajrapani middle two 1
great significance 1
manjushri embodiment enlightened wisdom sometimes acts avalokiteshvaras disciple 1
doesnt benefit others 1
prepared thing 1
shakyamuni buddha another good example im saying 1
came world son king already enlightened 1
didnt need worldly hassles samsaric royalty hundreds wives 1
think needed hassle? 1
course didnt 1
beyond hassles nevertheless manifested way benefit others 1
similarly even supreme knowledge sutra tantra even youre arya even manjushri order benefit sangha community good majority participate activities much 1
busy dharma work sick mentioned exception made; ask permission 1
case feel guilty 1
everybody understand 1
theoretically tell monks nuns get early morning cant really push dont get early myself! 1
im bad example! 1
well depends time go bed 1
nature go bed early get late 1
im bad example dont follow 1
good learned people! 1
really strongly encourage go bed early get early 1
dont go bed 12: 30 1: 00 morning; 10: 00 11: 00 1
certainly midnight much better 1
get 5: 30 6: 00 morning practice pray meditate 1
many sangha seem like tibetans although dont really know tibetan trip comes 1
trip; dont know set example 1
dont prayers commitments morning hang distractedly day 1
midnight suddenly freak pull books finally get commitments 1
put pechas knees front soon start reciting nod 1
wake continue fall asleep 1
wake find book floor start 1
takes couple hours three pages! 1
3: 00 1
lines fall asleep 1
goes like sun comes 1
give go sleep lunch time 1
tibetan trip good 1
dont know taught 1
better sleep soundly; sleep helps 1
least time mind tranquil peaceful gross mind absorbed 1
awaken clean-clear physically mentally rested healthy 1
saying prayers full concentration good motivation instead reciting mantras mindlessly "blah blah blah 1
okay finished! 1
sleep becomes comfortable clean-clear 1
much better way 1
day life important 1
entire life made days one another 1
therefore organize life: "when get im going next ill 1
life becomes useful dont waste time 1
make program life youll see clearly waste time 1
example two hours spend talking nonsense friends benefits neither others 1
dont make program dont realize much time wasting 1
make general program within detailed schedule 1
you; flexible 1
somehow organize every day life 1
also make sure balance activities: intellect emotions practical application 1
organizing balanced day important 1
dont put one day together two days together one month together one year together finish wasting entire life 1
need organize lives 1
thats monastery comes 1
dont realize yet monastic life gives us schedule daily lives 1
grateful tell 1
went monastery rules made get together way could never done alone 1
monasteries useful 1
cant imagine much human beings accomplish; unbelievable 1
much sometimes unaware ability 1
put situation brings best surprise yourself: "incredible! 1
youve situation time look back done feel good proud 1
check happens youre place rules see disastrous effect mind 1
gives new appreciation monastic discipline 1
monastic rules important extremely important 1
example dharma celebration monks nuns living monastic life: feel? 1
beneficial not? 1
feel attitude changed not? 1
made life easier? 1
think answer questions yes 1
definitely true: supporting 1
thats exactly lam-rim teaches: knowledge reputation goodness comes mother sentient beings people 1
see scientifically true 1
kind metaphysical gobbledygook 1
important us support 1
however expect find rules monastery laid lord buddha 1
necessary local environment 1
accept instead negating "oh lord buddha never made rule 1
say cant that? 1
first without realizing already accepted principle existence rules 1
example long tibetan zen wear 1
lord buddha didnt say anything monks wearing long zens accept automatically 1
long zens tibetan culture 1
lord buddha explained detail teaching robe chö-gö never saw anything vinaya long zens 1
blindly accept 1
blindly accept certain things tibetan people them; thats stupid 1
however monastic rules make sense 1
help grow purpose 1
otherwise would make them? 1
would point 1
responsible seeing rules observed? 1
everybody authority? 1
anyone say "blah blah blah 1
abbot gekö authority enforce monastic rules 1
therefore go monastery accept "the abbot gekö dear friends spiritual friends leaders 1
attitude motivation rather think "im spanish hes american 1
listen him? 1
"im italian tibetan monk doesnt eat pizza 1
take notice says? 1
cant offer pizza mozzarella 1
change attitude 1
kind; works hard 1
easy leader; compassion 1
leaders trying help even though may experiencing many difficulties 1
dont think theyre power trips tell 1
understand rules benefit majority 1
one person 1
break rules damaging benefits majority; harming sentient beings 1
dont think harm others stab knife something flagrant like 1
destroying benefits majority community means harming 1
ignorance like that; sees "my benefit 1
putting difficulties people idea monastic life like tibet; really hard 1
comparison life almost god-realm existence-even though almost every day find something complain about: "theres running water 1
blah blah blah 1
dont comfortable beds 1
go village see poor indian people live put simple cots sleep street 1
tibetan monasteries monks would sometimes sit night cold ground winter 1
necessary underwent many hardships 1
wed create hardships purpose sake putting them; would stupid 1
theres benefit prepared struggle bother 1
attitude "as long contributes growth benefits mother sentient beings ill put hardship best 1
thats reasonable isnt it? 1
im saying undergo extreme milarepa trip somehow face difficulties attitude "as long beneficial others ill put it; doesnt matter 1
thats reason became monk nun 1
ive given serving one person; one woman one man 1
really want serve benefit majority sentient beings much possibly 1
truly right attitude 1
people gather world dualistic mind naturally 1
eat tsampa eat pizza others like hamburgers 1
many cultural distinctions 1
difficult; im blaming anything 1
understandable group create difficulties; cant make differences kind multicultural soup 1
although differences exist trying emphasize culture 1
instead trying focus essential aspects buddhadharma 1
important thing; weve gathered dharma celebration 1
lord buddhas dharma wisdom reason weve come together 1
else would bother third world tibetan monk? 1
no; dharma hearts weve come live together spirit lam-rim understanding mother sentient beings equal desiring happiness wanting misery 1
extent share attitude fortunate 1
responsibilities sangha community leaders abbot gekö also compassion sangha community thinking "what best way help education make happy time make comfortable? 1
abbot gekö incredibly big responsibility job understand take care monks nuns physically mentally 1
youre concerned mental well-being difficulties; think leading ascetic milarepa-like existence extremely difficult 1
living tibet 1
french society room milarepas 1
try live like milarepa france theyll arrest 1
cant milarepa trip developed world 1
see easy take care sangha community 1
sangha community doesnt involve yourself; involves everybody hundreds people 1
abbot gekˆ monastery management know care physical mental requirements monks nuns 1
important concerned become dharma fanatic 1
abbot organizers fact every sangha member ability talent attitude "besides pursuing education important serve sangha especially future generations 1
see experience beneficial monk nun want serve sangha ensuring come perfect monastic facilities study practice 1
catholic church provides excellent example take care monks nuns 1
put incredible emphasis lot valuable experience 1
dont look catholics examples; thats mistake 1
take advantage good aspects catholic monasticism integrating dharma communities 1
sangha community leader needs flexible 1
sangha members prefer certain kinds work provided qualified let rather forcing clean something else 1
take peoples wishes abilities consideration 1
time passes peoples attitudes behavior change people develop change jobs accordingly 1
ways sangha like baby 1
babies grow babies change; minds abilities develop 1
leader also remember assigning tasks monastery 1
however monks nuns right determine best schedule themselves; right say whatever want long benefits majority 1
wrong abbot gekö force nonsensical schedule onto community 1
us take responsibility 1
especially people; longer young try act like children 1
dedicate act benefit majority 1
feel incredible potential largely responsible establishing dharma west benefit future generations 1
great expectations expectations realistic exaggerated 1
different ways practicing growing dharma 1
people meditate; others better organizing 1
become dharma 1
mahayana means great view universal view 1
enormous amount space mahayana accommodate different forms practice almost enough room person unique individual path 1
lord buddhas incredible skill 1
dont think monastery rules oppressive prevent expressing intuition 1
should-in fact do-allow express 1
dont think monastery concentration camp 1
contrary monastic life blissful tell 1
say people live monasteries completely protected; monastic life allows progress right direction without interference 1
thats monastery really 1
people whose lives disaster though monastic life like thorn side like concentration camp 1
certain aspects monastic life changed 1
change things better since exist order benefit others even general public make suggestions long offered great compassion eye future 1
monasterys education program? 1
think balancing three wisdoms hearing analytical contemplation meditation important thing 1
monastery three must balanced 1
simultaneously must also exercised 1
shouldnt attitude "first ill study 10 20 years; next 30 years ill analyze ive learned; finally ill meditate im 100 1
thats common misunderstanding 1
true sakya pandita said "he meditates without first studying like armless rock climber 1
many people even learned geshes misinterpret statement 1
theyll tell first thing learn stuff; almost criminal meditate without first studying 1
course true cant make coca-cola without first heard coca-cola cant meditate without listened dharma teachings 1
misinterpretation conclude study 20 years analytical contemplation another 20 years say youre 60 begin meditate 1
completely wrong 1
tibetans attitude lama tsong khapa 1
even boy meditated 1
went retreat manjushri 16 met him: manjushri appeared rock cave 1
remember story? 1
term rang-jung [self-originated] manjushri 1
lama tsong khapa combined everything everyday life: listening analytical checking meditation 1
put three together 1
same: every day three practiced 1
dont go long time one without others 1
thats wrong conception 1
even boy sera monastery victim misconceptions 1
used love praying keep small prayer book hidden uncle took care didnt like sitting meditation position prayers 1
hed tell crazy; that-theres tibetan expression this-" hair goes gray thats meditate 1
whenever came id hide prayer book long philosophy pecha supposed studying 1
okay long didnt know doing! 1
complete misconception 1
difficult study philosophy nothing else 1
sometimes debate someone would making argument would completely space knowing debate 1
two three hours would sit nothing 1
combining prayer study kept earth balanced want people 1
excellent understanding three principal aspects path enlightenment extensive lam-rim studies 1
basis fundamental understanding practice little philosophical study well every day lam-rim become beautiful 1
organization see people incredible level intellectual understanding hearts much dharma 1
please sympathy 1
ive watching students see 1
example people like "oh want learn tibetan language study different subjects want practice everything 1
couple years study become expert tibetan language give dharma 1
never practice lam-rim; lam-rim nothing 1
seen this; amazing 1
sometimes dharma people study tibetan language becomes tibetan-style-they never practice 1
im criticizing everybody definitely people like 1
guess learned tibetan language came know tibetan samsara 1
instead becoming liberated get caught tibetan samsara 1
know history every samsaric culture good 1
youre caught samsaric culture cant differentiate cultures garbage thought dharma; cant distinguish one 1
sometimes people studied tibetan whose hearts truly dharma better integrate lives life west studied tibetan language 1
course cant say always like saying different ways looking 1
therefore organizers structure life nalanda monastery try balance teaching study meditation daily life 1
im going go details experience situation sera different west france 1
need different schedule one accords environment 1
cannot make tibetan style 1
however tibetan way certain periods intensive study certain homework-like periods 1
example one month could devoted community study according monasterys schedule next personal study room 1
cycle repeated 1
way intensity study cycle varies 1
think that; im going details 1
perhaps another time today 1
education program monastery balanced sangha produce intellectually clean-clear therefore universally accepted 1
sangha practice basis pure thought always puts benefit majority first minds develop people see compassionate dedicated 1
kinds monks nuns want monasteries produce 1
syllabus include sutra tantra; take opportunity study tantra 1
monks nuns perfectly educated sutra tantra 1
thats way grow quickly order benefit others 1
need take break studies vacation fpmt organizational work personal work leave monastery without permission abbot gekˆ 1
investigate situation decide compassion benefit 1
developing sangha organization important everybody contribute something development organization 1
example monks nuns money take care food clothing forth 1
money dont work say two three hours day benefit organization aim creating strong sangha community 1
really dedicated always fit everything 1
lazy; therefore rationalize 1
cant even manage one-hour puja 1
dont think youre rationalizing mind finds difficult spend hour sangha community puja? 1
"i dont time; hour long 1
youre going say arent you? 1
thats completely unrealistic; compassion 1
western monks nuns come india nepal tell shouldnt work food clothing tibetan monasteries monks dont work 1
"the monks tibetan monastery bouddha dont jobs; we? 1
live black tea tsampa? 1
youll dead next day 1
tibetans live like 1
look tibetan monks faces: see eat tsampa black tea! 1
injis cant 1
pink skins come good nutritious food! 1
couldnt survive tibetan monastic diet 1
think capable needs done society given good education; dont waste time energy trying tibetan 1
costs $500 month eat way youve brought up-not west 1
whos going give money? 1
think scientifically 1
part western culture parents work order support adult children 1
anyway youre capable supporting 1
really cant work youre crippled youve broken leg perhaps thats exception 1
well educated good dont take care 1
course rich family ask support 1
parents well responsibility take care 1
happen western culture 1
whether money monastery give selfish needs work help others much 1
unless cant see benefit community monks nuns 1
sangha community important not? 1
see not? 1
id like know think 1
yes is! 1
lama yeshes effort 1
people think lama yeshe it; cant anything 1
talk "blah blah blah 1
act make community successful; hands 1
cant it; responsibility 1
really worthwhile 1
lets say think 1
would bother people running time? 1
could disappear cave go beach sleep comfortable 1
would better 1
however feel necessary somehow act benefit others much always obsessed pursuit pleasure always "me 1
thats wrong thats wrong 1
try benefit others much possibly can; important thing 1
choice: help alone benefit many people 1
choose benefit many 1
remember says guru puja? 1
"if benefits even one sentient spend eons hell 1
remember verse? 1
way panchen lama put text together incredible 1
"to bring dharma west benefit entire world prepared give comfort 1
think like 1
important bringing dharma west 1
people live realistically culture relate westerners better 1
anyway im die cant 1
best feel "i responsible bringing dharma west 1
thats reason became monk; thats reason became nun 1
great significance dedicate way 1
develop sort motivation appropriate actions follow spontaneously; wont force 1
dont think bad thing monks nuns work bread butter 1
else going take care you? 1
mother sentient beings serve you? 1
west thing someone someone elses servant 1
look convinced completely bring dharma west; people convinced 1
nuclear energy movement 1
got ordained decided dedicate entire lives benefit others 1
taught attitude said words got ordained didnt you? 1
said "for benefit mother sentient beings becoming monk/ nun 1
say didnt you? 1
okay said it-we agree that! 1
dont husbands wives; lives committed one person 1
dont think youre married me! 1
youre free arent you? 1
understand mean 1
thats point: completely free 1
dedicate without discrimination mother sentient beings; job 1
truly feel bring dharma western world living kind purity 1
purity gives power words offer dharma west 1
living dharma westintellectual dharma already reached west 1
many cases western professors know subject better 1
words dharma; need something behind words 1
need kind energy force developed organically living purely dharma 1
truly root dharma spread west 1
great expectations people it; please think 1
dharma trying bring west simply intellectual dharma 1
intellectual dharma already universities world 1
want understand 1
need living experience dharma touch human heart organically eradicate peoples dissatisfaction 1
western worlds great need 1
without living dharma without certain degree experience cannot give dharma others 1
live sangha community abbot gekö involved deciding goes teach 1
trip youre danger turning dharma coca-cola 1
course need well educated go different places teach least intellectually clean-clear comprehension subjects talking 1
otherwise might start spreading misconceptions instead benefiting dharma damage 1
serious phenomenon 1
dont think youre playing games tibetan monks tibetan mahayana buddhism 1
dedicate much possibly whatever way-words deeds intellect meditation-for sake sentient beings; utilize lives benefit 1
whatever sincerity good enough 1
without sincerity many things become good enough 1
theres dedication 1
program enlightened experience celebration created principally benefit monks nuns 1
thought extremely important monks nuns receive truly complete education 1
wont worried; wherever go take light dharma 1
main point 1
addition organized event lay students could also attend 1
lets stop continue tomorrow 1
purpose nalanda monasteryit important consider present dharma west 1
cant say "oh director invited come give teachings 1
okay ill go 1
happened many times im sure suitable situation 1
therefore wanted say little education nalanda monastery 1
purpose nalanda monastery? 1
center education buddhist studies 1
ideally means eventually sangha become teachers 1
come on! 1
want understand 1
teacher doesnt mean intellectual words teacher 1
many different ways teach 1
generally however expect everybody well educated 1
great demand teachers centers; short teachers 1
aware not? 1
everybody know 1
put energy trying benefit others instead lazy 1
worlds need dharma teachers great 1
way work centers need teachers send requests monastery abbot gekö decide goes teach 1
thats good idea; prevents people individual trips 1
course center director specify qualifications even person required—" best us way communicate"— something like 1
people trip good 1
also kind competition; trying beneficial possible 1
feel sometimes western teachers suitable western beginners 1
oriented culture may acceptable new students: "this need; use 1
encourage westerners kind thing 1
course tibetan lamas still come give advanced teachings limitations well 1
therefore hurry educate well maximum benefit others 1
sangha community many students already experienced giving lam-rim courses 1
teaching im happy 1
sangha members intuitively understood teach; didnt push 1
others dont understand teach worry it: "lama said everybody teach 1
could possibly become teacher? 1
dont worry 1
whatever ability much life 1
way thinking thats good enough 1
dont necessarily push accumulate intellectual knowledge 1
room people serve buddhadharma many different ways 1
future organize monastery situation well benefiting others education also provide bread butter 1
feel cannot take care moment life tibetan buddhist monk nun means youll always economic trouble 1
kind mind arises sometimes; good 1
quite right think situation many people world need teachers well-educated support 1
center applies sangha member come teach center take care persons airfare food clothing stipend 1
sangha kind big view 1
educate well serve others others take care you; natural 1
offer something benefit others others benefit 1
thats cyclic nature samsara 1
people figure constructive approach 1
concerned welfare since im ignorant take care even could possibly know whats best futures? 1
course quote shakyamuni buddha one sutra guaranteed even amount arable land earth reduced size fingernail long sangha practiced purely would never go hungry 1
true not? 1
come on! 1
cant true! 1
well dont know lord buddha correct 1
doubt whether words true observation many sangha practicing studying sincerely encountered trouble getting means living food clothing benefactors 1
experienced kind trouble? 1
well western culture theres custom benefacting monks nuns; difficult 1
days even tibetan culture difficult 1
used tibetan monks nuns pretty easy like longer 1
dont think go bananas worrying whether someone take care us 1
days sangha intelligent know whats going world educated certain extent… least primary school level! 1
people capable taking care 1
dont need two three everything need take care bodies get sick 1
take care body 1
dont need try lead ascetic life thinking youre great meditator thereby damaging nervous system 1
one hand talk precious human rebirth destroy body 1
thats stupid 1
servant others monks nuns practical taking care socially acceptable work benefit majority 1
sangha cannot work benefit others whats about? 1
honestly motivation "i servant others 1
perhaps instead om mani padme hum mantra 1
repeat "i servant others servant others… 1
think im going make monks nuns mantra make repeat million times; make retreat mantra "i servant others 1
sometimes monks nuns wrong conceptions 1
consider holy live alone leading ascetic life 1
thats necessarily so; dont need 1
people fantasy becoming tibetan monk nun become kind great yogi 1
makes great yogi dedication others 1
without dedication others theres way become great yogi yogini 1
maybe think serving others impractical doesnt work 1
works works 1
less pain mind 1
somebody asks cup tea help instead pain anger irritation feel bliss 1
get angry someone asks help shows dedication 1
sometimes lay people criticize monks nuns think theyre hopeless— come home eat drink dont anything help 1
dont even wash dishes; leave others 1
space say words dharma blah blah 1
lay people dont understand 1
western culture 1
tell big difference way westerners look dharma way eastern people 1
parents dont accept youre think youre hopeless stupid taking care life 1
thats worry 1
parents love 1
want practical take care 1
heard lay people criticize sangha? 1
theyre right point 1
dont think always right lay people always wrong 1
buddhadharma practical organic; something put effect 1
sometimes people misconception "ah enlightenment goal" looking sky hands folded hearts 1
"up husband buddha dharma sangha 1
dont care anything 1
call fanaticism; feet arent ground 1
practical okay? 1
fanaticism ego arrogant unreasonable intangible; people simply dreaming 1
perhaps tibetan buddhism say sake mother sentient beings quickly become buddha therefore im going practice… sadhana 1
maybe sadhana way thinking western misunderstanding 1
dont know 1
perhaps mahayana buddhism produces spaced sentient beings instead constructive organic flowers… perhaps im extreme? 1
aware lay people think 1
understand sometimes little paralyzing monk nun live community majority lay people 1
one; feel insignificant 1
try fulfill sangha obligations nobody 1
try compromise lay community doesnt work either 1
dont want sangha put kind situation environmental economic realities sometimes force 1
nalanda finally opportunity live away situations least wont able blame conditions difficulties 1
monastic environment extremely important 1
sometimes get impression sangha think wont able keep vows get job; work become disasters monks nuns 1
completely wrong attitude; shows suffocated ignorance 1
human beings lord buddha also given us method wisdom 1
somehow able figure put work keeping ordination together avoid suffocating alternative 1
many students given impression 1
dont know true picture 1
monasteries exist west 1
monks nuns human; eat sleep work 1
true picture 1
dont follow example 1
perhaps christian monks nuns work still manage keep ordinations capable buddhists 1
ashamed ourselves! 1
dont become catholic monks nuns? 1
youd problems 1
im joking! 1
anyway saying want use wisdom 1
cannot tell 1
trust use method wisdom come way establishing western monastery take care materially duty according vinaya 1
motivate accomplish this? 1
want generate strong motivation otherwise wont make 1
many obstacles many hurdles 1
expect mistakes made 1
even bringing dharma tibet many bodhisattvas killed protecting ordination 1
know history buddhism coming tibet? 1
actually killed would break vows 1
compare situation dharma came tibet see lucky 1
much better facilities education far easier lives back 1
people incredibly lucky 1
still want one strongly motivated personal level: "i responsible bringing dharma west 1
ive understood lord buddhas wisdom powerful brought great satisfaction world needs anything else 1
doesnt mean change completely overnight tomorrow walk around like crazy evangelist 1
relaxed time dedicated 1
youll happy matter sort difficult situation find in— happy youre serving others 1
dedication every situation painful fundamental human problem self-cherishing thought wanting share anything others opposite dedication 1
dedicated attitude makes everybody brothers sisters 1
without others become thorns flesh; hurt hassle especially living together many people 1
feel others hassle place crowded like concentration camp lama yeshe like dictator comes around mornings saying that… 1
sure might thoughts like 1
dedicated attitude even people accuse something give hard time actually helps; truly helps 1
personally really believe humans need go hardships order develop understanding 1
youre always going around spaced everythings easy youll never learn 1
learned mao tse tung put learning situation 1
otherwise pretty easy-going 1
long parents giving everything uncle giving everything never learned thing 1
later checked back see id learned dharma time 1
hadnt; full intellectual word games 1
mao made face real life 1
time learned lot 1
gratitude sangha thats want dedicated time happy 1
dont understand youre happy 1
sangha together warm close feeling 1
im highly educated man im highly realized person feel grateful existence sangha 1
give strength 1
understand existing youre helping 1
seems dont understand 1
words perhaps dont understand value buddhadharma 1
dont feel sangha community wonderful members help dont understand buddhadharma; dont understand dharma dharma 1
especially times like many monks nuns gathered together recognize respect actual sangha 1
perhaps cant respect individual "he sangha; sangha" take refuge according vinaya absolutely must respect sangha community sangha object refuge 1
received vinaya teachings tara tulku bodhgaya recently im sure told four monks nuns together sangha didnt he? 1
well dont leave 1
inside heart recognition "that sangha 1
feel respect 1
feel fortunate met people least trying live 36 precepts novice ordination 1
world today rare 1
think brothers sisters trying keep 36 vows rare not? 1
yes; theyre rare 1
understand spiritual significance youll understand valuable 1
want understand: brothers sisters husband wife dollars precious possessions everything! 1
everybody understands value things dont they? 1
well one valuable rare precious million dollars 1
feel rich! 1
true; im joking 1
really believe 1
people feel extremely fortunate kind situation 1
look around— earth find situation? 1
days world becoming incredibly impure full garbage thoughts superstition mutual hatred least people try feel compassion loving kindness one another instead seeing heavy burdens 1
fortunate people world 1
look present situation 1
morning go puja serve tea 1
soon thats breakfast ready 1
go teachings 1
tea waiting 1
practice take care mind; everything 1
incredibly fortunate 1
unbelievably fortunate 1
take advantage 1
negative attitude toward group sangha thats worst bad karma create tell 1
according taught think "i hate international sangha" creating heavy karma 1
buddhist point view criticizing sangha negative thing 1
know amongst group sangha bodhisattva arhat? 1
cant tell 1
complaining "these western sangha theyre good theyre theyre that…" one worst things world 1
point individuals say "lama yeshes good" group seventy eighty monks nuns come together say theyre good? 1
thats heaviest karma create 1
honestly tell many people whole world keeping 36 vows? 1
many even trying? 1
normally say monasteries good 1
monasteries empty buildings 1
"monasteries good; monastery life good 1
empty building monastery 1
monastery good group people putting incredible positive energy living organic purity 1
without people concrete wood 1
thats monastery 1
monasteries produce many learned scholars many saints people live help 1
wood doesnt produce scholars; water doesnt produce saints 1
therefore establishing nalanda monastery produce many saints scholars 1
thats called nalanda 1
like ancient indian monastery nalanda produced great indian pandits atisha naropa shantideva 1
really feel monastery produce saints pandits 1
dont worry intellectual clarity buddhadharma cant reach western world 1
westerners comprehend anything tibetans 1
monastic robes let say words robes 1
past years ive experience travelling around world living sangha students dharma center communities 1
feel great compassion monks nuns 1
ill tell reason 1
monks nuns try good human beings keep precepts responsibly go outside center people spit them: "oh look poor man poor woman 1
ive seen eyes; incredible 1
feel sad 1
theres nothing wrong sangha; people spit theyre poor ones 1
put students kind situation society viewed disasters rather respect people regard garbage 1
recognizing profound human quality people get ordained wear robes get put 1
im sure worth 1
see understanding dharma bringing western world western dharma inji dharma tibetan dharma 1
historically dharma never went one culture another without changing external form 1
internally course dharma never changes; essence buddhadharma remains pure 1
cant make germans americans eat tsampa; stomachs arent made 1
dont need external things 1
western societys point view people wearing robes considered bad human beings insult rest society 1
wearing robes 1
id sick negative attitude wear every day 1
well im sick; im happy robes 1
im saying country working relating people regular society think stubborn insist wearing robes people putting calling bad human 1
criticize buddhism: "buddhism produces bad human beings 1
thats theyre going say isnt it? 1
theyll say "buddhism creates hippies" think monks nuns responsible citizens socially unacceptable 1
lord buddha gets bad reputation; want give lord buddha bad reputation? 1
serious people; joking 1
people practicing dharma lama yeshe; thats case 1
dharma bringing west much bigger one person 1
psychologically course human likes thing 1
example im tibetan monk; think tibetan way best world; want become tibetan style 1
act look tibetan im happy youre supporting 1
thats stupid way thinking imaginable; basis reality 1
happy pizza-loving italians; happy; happy 1
pizza-eating italian likes dharma whose mind subdued incredible 1
true picture italians 1
wants artificial italians? 1
anyway theyll never change! 1
monks nuns monastery dharma center wear robes; fine 1
go put exactly clothes everybody else wearing dont look different lay people 1
thats dangerous; im happy 1
somehow signify youre monk nun people recognize remember 1
lord buddhas intention sangha wear robes 1
clothes wear signify youre ordained distinguish lay people remind obligations allow others recognize monk nun 1
conclusion need wear something people recognize follower kind path feel different laity 1
make behavior completely different 1
free influence vibrations wear something vibrates show youre monk nun 1
protect garbage thoughts 1
therefore saying important change outside appearance according culture 1
last year surveyed people various different centers thought dharma students agreed sangha needed modify traditional robes west people upset 1
side didnt feel need change; change requires thought 1
reality western dharma students thought sangha wear something different traditional robes 1
mean well; want give good impression 1
fact upset people do? 1
youve experience wearing robes public west youll understand well 1
otherwise youll thinking "what lama talking about? 1
beautiful wearing robes want wear robes want wear guru wears dont want wear something samsaric 1
however entirely different culture 1
buddhism went india tibet monks robes changed completely; theres nothing indian left 1
thing happened buddhism went china japan korea vietnam 1
course similarities basically different 1
cannot say dharma bad dharma 1
cannot say tibetan dharma better better wear tibetan robes 1
would ego trip 1
climates cultures vary people compromise come something suits environment 1
lets agree need consider making changes robes slowly slowly well check 1
dharamsala wear exactly robes tibetans wear; tibetan people happy 1
tibetan; dont think tibetan 1
youre going spend life west country 1
therefore think 1
example shem-thab 1
thai monks dont wear tibetans; dont wear zens either whats big deal? 1
important thing robes wear signify identify monk nun 1
ultimately course robes dont mean anything 1
invite lay people give opinions whether sangha wear 1
good people judge 1
majority doesnt like wearing robes makes angry profitable not? 1
good way dress upsets 1
lay people important comes interacting monks nuns 1
cant say monks nuns everything lay people nothing therefore going trip 1
youd wrong 1
beyond society 1
society; linked lay people 1
lay people also accept us 1
theyre stupid 1
theyre concerned buddhadharma; want buddhadharma much 1
theres tibetan admonition "do anything destroy laitys faith devotion dharma 1
monks nuns aware create karma destroying lay peoples faith dharma 1
lord buddha taught sangha socially acceptable 1
society feel "monks nuns good; object refuge 1
always remember act accordingly 1
lets questions answers 1
sometimes get bit extreme talk nonsense makes angry 1
well dont want please express anything benefit us 1
think hair length especially women may even important issue robes 1
thats true 1
think sangha west already started keeping hair little longer 1
understand rather criticize them; experience 1
many nuns working society center directors theyve grow hair little order relate better people encounter 1
feel thats perfectly acceptable; dont you? 1
important understand other; wont problems amongst us 1
thats best way 1
understand different country considers good behavior monks nuns act accordingly order benefit society 1
lama hope organize meeting lay people discuss robes 1
good idea 1
lay people love dharma therefore love sangha 1
want sangha best behavior world 1
feel sangha lay people make one society 1
within society kinds different groups still feel unity one family 1
new-style robes adopted would western countries? 1
wed make decision international level 1
people many different countries agreed change 1
dont need wear tibetan-style robes 1
course gradually; theres need radical changes 1
example even weve changed people still want wear tibetan robes monastery okay let 1
think changes make 1
sometimes hard new monk know behave 1
guidance come older monks even though dont really old western monks senior ones much experience newly ordained 1
historically older monks always taken responsibility see new ones properly nurtured facilitate spiritual growth 1
feel difficult get around places sangha 1
therefore older monks nuns take responsibility young ones 1
go monasteries south india youll see opposite youd normally expect: making sure get educated means living older monks almost servants young ones 1
far weve able definitely 1
much contact future western monks nuns? 1
different monasteries? 1
separate monasteries 1
already 50 monks 50 nuns definitely broader vision 1
future going many more; monks nuns communities going grow… thousands millions! 1
figure going take care 1
check got ordained see logical others also become monks nuns 1
organization grows facilitates spread dharma produce better educated teachers natural therell monks nuns 1
therefore responsibility create conducive conditions future sangha 1
may faced difficulties coming early time establish better facilities coming separate places monks nuns 1
basically nuns responsible future nuns monks future monks since sangha community help 1
nalanda monastery france beginning 1
everybody wants go france 1
one thing language much! 1
future going nalanda monasteries european country australia western countries 1
happen power buddhadharma wish 1
let go 1
dont think lama yeshe wants million monks nuns 1
whod want trouble! 1
think became monks nuns; interesting 1
see future many others want 1
therefore dedicate creating better facilities 1
getting back problem older western monks nuns taking care younger ones think partly result cultural influence 1
tibet mentioned senior monks nuns take great care young ones 1
saw older western sangha didnt went culture shock; didnt understand 1
dont older monks nuns; 1
ambition look new ones 1
think that? 1
lets hear one nun one monk 1
well older nuns dont want take care new ones; sometimes young ones dont want told 1
yes thats possible 1
ive found older monks helpful ive asked 1
yes thats right 1
perhaps new monks ask older ones respectfully respond 1
develop good relationships like 1
gekö kopan older monks nuns created trouble point view difficult respect 1
yes thats good example 1
sometimes true older monks nuns dont co-operate benefit group— make incredible rationalizations based individual trips 1
ive seen 1
hope situation changing older monks becoming concerned benefit majority trips 1
sometimes older sangha may realize theyre senior ones; might still think theyre fairly new 1
look behind see many young ones 1
thats true; thats good example 1
definitely happens 1
still think theyre young 1
anyway want emphasize want senior monks nuns take responsibility ensuring future generations sangha comfortable well-educated growth benefit others 1
benefits ordained lama zopa rinpoche essay prepared rinpoche publication mandala september-october 1996 1
initially dictated ven 1
roger kunsang amplified help ven 1
paul lemay 1
talk westerners life buddha 12 deeds— circumstances birth life child marriage birth child renunciation householders life becoming monk forth— might think ordination buddhist monk nun asians 1
buddha lived india might think aspect eastern culture unrelated west 1
moreover buddha lived 500 years ago might also think ordination longer relevant today 1
common normal way think people dont understand mind know karma 1
describe hell realms 1
buddha explained ancient times people think theyre simply outmoded concept 1
hells dont exist means nobody creating karma reborn 1
words everybody must developed stable realizations 1
mean that? 1
order never reborn lower realms must attained least third patience level path preparation 1
five levels path liberation; path preparation second 1
path preparation four levels patience third 1
two thousand years ago jesus christ also revealed living ordination method practice 1
result many christian monasteries nunneries established past two millennia still viable tradition produced many saints 1
people say ordination longer relevant modern world misunderstand purpose 1
method taught buddha jesus protect us delusions prevent us harming others 1
result karma harming others receive immediate benefit harmed experience great happiness peace 1
course long-term benefits well: rebirth upper realms liberation enlightenment 1
nevertheless people still ask today lay people study practice dharma attain enlightenment necessary live ordained life? 1
true lay people practice well doesnt mean lay people practice well 1
lay people find difficult 1
buddha jesus revealed method ordination doesnt mean everyone become monks nuns either 1
everybody cant become sangha everybody doesnt karma become sangha 1
need lot merit inner obstacles 1
obstacles mind outer obstacles ordination 1
main point developed stable realization three principal aspects path mind practice dharma properly need spend lot time away objects induce delusions arise 1
especially true beginners fact applies anybody yet liberated samsara 1
hence need monasteries nunneries caves hermitages discipline goes along living ascetic environments 1
living places like easily see importance morality 1
actualize fundamental paths need great deal study meditation 1
need much time conducive circumstances 1
important thing mind distracted 1
negative karma create barriers erect realizations 1
makes much longer difficult experience even samsaric happiness let alone bliss liberation samsara 1
therefore live pure ordination less negative karma create 1
renouncing life householder living sangha create less negative karma also cut lot external work activities 1
leaves much time meditation study; fewer distractions 1
thus many advantages ordained: time study meditate time develop mind 1
one important meditations need accomplish order really develop path enlightenment mind mental quiescence 1
realize shamatha need much discipline protection morality; eliminate many distractions 1
even hours good meditation need cut distractions apply discipline renounce attachment 1
follow attachment cant meditate even minute 1
mind occupied desire objects boyfriends girlfriends cant meditate even second 1
basis simple example understand living ordination sangha makes much easier practice 1
environment becomes important 1
maintain inspiration remain sangha continue practicing develop mind path liberation enlightenment month month year year continue beginner whose mind stabilized three principal aspects path calm abiding forth need right situation 1
environment strong effect mind 1
controls mind person let alone realizations doesnt even practice lam-rim 1
even excellent understanding lam-rim teachings dont practice external objects influence control overpower overwhelm mind 1
whether lay person ordained without choice seek run objects attachment 1
soon start practice meditate three principal paths— especially basic one renunciation— mind becomes powerful external objects 1
moment begin apply teachings buddha daily life mind starts become powerful external objects overcome attraction matter objects may be: living beings non-living things handsome people beautiful flowers whatever 1
practicing lam-rim delusions control 1
beginners need practice lam-rim strongly keep away disturbing objects 1
minds weak since beginningless time habituated attachment path enlightenment 1
therefore delusions strong especially youre surrounded disturbing objects 1
intention desire seek liberation weak wish samsara objects delusion pleasure desire strong 1
therefore need strong lam-rim meditation subdue control mind attachment time need retreat keep distance objects attachment 1
dont withdraw internal suffering attachment desire living ordination surrounded objects desire like trying get cool sitting front fire 1
course setting good external environment western sangha one thing individual sangha members choosing stay another 1
establish perfect environment individual monks nuns decide stay stay instead wrong environment 1
minds weak realizations stability path overwhelmed external objects 1
delusions take minds follow delusions therefore unable practice dharma live vows 1
basis fundamental error instead enjoying life feeling fortunate think advantages experience— good results liberation enlightenment absolute certainty good rebirth matter die— life become difficult living ordination seem like living prison 1
morality passport success guarantee upper rebirth 1
like university degree guarantees respect good job 1
immediate urgent thing stop rebirth lower realms: morality guarantee also basis foundation liberation enlightenment 1
therefore extremely necessary establish right environment practice 1
buddha explained many benefits ordination sutra teachings also enumerated lam-rim 1
twice-monthly so-jong ceremony recall shortcoming breaking vows receive inspiration reciting benefits 1
benefits include enjoying glory radiant body effortless fame others praise good qualities gaining happiness 1
moral conduct pure others harm 1
important point note: harmed others must created cause must harmed 1
think logic 1
blind person cannot see neither immoral person liberated 1
live morality like people without legs cannot walk wherever wish 1
vase meant holding jewels cannot hold anything broken similarly since morality basis realizations break vows unable achieve dharma realizations 1
without foundation morality way attain sorrowless state nirvana 1
benefits taught buddha recited so-jong 1
responsibility monk nun make plan protect him-or living right environment 1
purpose monasteries nunneries; thats vinaya rules 1
help protect mind 1
protecting guarding mind free problems obstacles suffering ultimately liberating oceans suffering samsaric realm 1
fulfill aspirations happiness bring much happiness sentient beings well 1
many precepts vinaya tell given buddha order protect minds others 1
follow vinaya rules prevent others criticizing sangha karmically speaking heavy object 1
negative karma created sangha object extremely grave 1
however sangha careless sentient beings minds feelings happiness suffering easily possible provoke criticism 1
therefore since sangha responsible guide laity follow vinaya correctly 1
others generate faith minds toward sangha planting minds seeds liberation enlightenment 1
may even inspire follow path taking ordination since normally sentient beings follow buddhas example practice dharma 1
sangha makes others respect thereby create much merit 1
purely live ordination greater power success pray others 1
prayers pujas behalf others likely succeed 1
living purely achieve result easily mantras recite powerful 1
deities buddhas dharma protectors listen requests help 1
purity choice 1
even dont make requests naturally serve help 1
also since life pure sentient beings make offerings create even merit also danger accepting offerings 1
says teachings live purely eat offered like drinking lava molten iron 1
said youd better consuming molten iron consuming offerings made others devotion 1
also teach much greater effect peoples minds lay people teach; theres big difference 1
people receiving teaching see teacher him-or living renunciation 1
lay people respect leading life cannot 1
recognizing quality hard achieve respect 1
also lay students learn regard sangha way allow devotion arise 1
lay people think sangha special qualities fail make offerings support sangha miss great chance create good karma 1
lay people protect minds practice morality even try help others unable offer perfect service 1
trying help others problems difficulties always arise ego three poisonous minds 1
without dharma practice one cant really offer perfect service others without running problems 1
whether one leader country kind public service sooner later problems arise 1
even normal daily life like this: without morality without protecting mind without kind discipline cant really find peace satisfaction happiness fulfillment heart 1
big advantage ordained extremely important would guru shakyamuni buddha set example? 1
according mahayana teachings buddhas showing reached enlightenment bodhgaya really became enlightened 1
reality reached enlightenment inconceivable number eons ago 1
reason went 12 deeds— including renouncing family life shaving head becoming monk— taught four noble truths teach us practice dharma 1
said buddhism teaches followers live ordained persons monasteries nunneries 1
also buddhism teaches attainment nine levels meditative concentration development shamatha 1
practice also common hinduism morality discipline also practiced along renunciation accomplished without taking refuge buddha dharma sangha simply developing detachment pleasure renunciation desire realms thinking shortcomings form realm 1
finally thinking shortcomings remaining first three four levels formless realm attain whats called "peak samsara 1
cannot renounce samsara entirely; thats taught hinduism 1
theres mention ultimate liberation five paths emptiness 1
without understanding prasangika view highest four schools buddhist philosophy theres way free samsara 1
nevertheless studying methods religions without even taking account buddhist way see great importance place ordination morality discipline 1
therefore generalizing west nobody get ordained everybody practice lay people wrong conception 1
misunderstanding arises really knowing dharma especially karma much importantly lacking meditation experience realization samsaric suffering especially lower realms impermanence death 1
even person understanding dharma merely intellectual depending individual persons mind remain get worse; delusions become even stronger 1
thus person leads life according delusion: delusion becomes ones refuge ones best friend ones guru 1
way peoples lives become difficult confused 1
even ordained externally might appear sangha shaved head inside may opposite 1
course nobody makes life difficult; imprison samsara following delusion 1
experiences actually result practiced dharma continuously start telling everybody else good idea monk better practice dharma lay person 1
tibet make tsa-tsas clay images buddhas deities usually made metal molds 1
>from one mold make thousands images 1
making faulty mold practicing dharma trying cast others mistaken image bad way making tsa-tsas 1
heres makes difficult lead life monk nun 1
set heart attaining bliss nirvana life becomes easy; even run problems bear hardships pleasure; theyre important mind 1
however goal samsaric pleasure even people dont cause problems make life difficult 1
even others consider something okay mind see hard 1
therefore find living ordination depends goal thats heart 1
change goal samsara liberation enlightenment keep 24 hours day youll problem 1
heart clear life torn 1
naturally cant samsara nirvana 1
kadampa geshes liked say cant sew two-pointed needle 1
cant seek happiness life happiness dharma 1
try lose happiness dharma 1
therefore cannot generalize say days especially west ordination irrelevant everybody practice lay people 1
completely wrong 1
life well lived lama zopa rinpoche secret hayagriva retreat vajrapani institute september– october 1997 lama zopa rinpoche offered students following advice 1
came rinpoches reading long commentary secret hayagriva sadhana elaborates refuge section: attain state all-pervading lord samantabhadra sentient beings without exception equaling limitless sky take refuge three jewels essence rare sublimity entire assembly mandala deities 1
beginningless samsara right second kind mother sentient beings control three poisonous minds 1
motivated three poisonous minds created various karmas 1
result taking various bodies peak samsara lowest realm vajra hell experiencing constantly unbearable sufferings samsara general three lower realms particular 1
power save kind suffering mother sentient beings this? 1
guru triple gem abiding 1
please guru triple gem right protect kind mother sentient beings extremely terrifying sufferings samsara particularly three lower realms 1
moment see face buddha samantabhadra never abandon object refuge precious sublime triple gem matter happens life— good bad happiness suffering 1
tibetan terms used commentary zang-ngän interpreted different ways 1
generally zang means good ngän means bad also mean pure impure happiness suffering 1
broadly related lives good mean easy life things go smoothly bad mean difficult life encounter many obstacles problems 1
however good bad depends upon individuals interpretation 1
dharma point view spend life creating virtue non-virtue thats good life 1
last year created positive negative karma good year; yesterday created merit negativity good day 1
even spend half time virtue thats still pretty good 1
depends look 1
compare someone creates negative karma 24 hours day relatively creating hours virtue every day good life 1
quarter days virtue obviously better none 1
thats general definition good life bad: relative proportion positive karma negative 1
24-hour stretch able collect virtue non-virtue even though might feel exhausted even though might almost died practicing dharma life day good 1
look naropa example 1
undergo twelve great twelve lesser hardships order fulfill instructions guru tilopa 1
nevertheless best possible lives 1
milarepa face many difficulties 1
orders guru marpa three times construct immediately tear nine-story tower 1
never allowed come teachings initiations students always beaten scolded never heard praise "oh good disciple" "you done excellent practice 1
despite accomplishing whatever task set ever saw wrathful aspect teacher 1
however following marpas advice letter never allowing slightest negative thought arise milarepa attained enlightenment lifetime 1
think constitutes good life constitutes bad milarepas best 1
important know clearly difference good life bad one 1
connotation incorrect hallucinated opinion youll get confused 1
youll go wrong direction result mind finish empty attainments empty realizations— completely empty anything worthwhile 1
thus interpret good bad according dharma wisdom right understanding lam-rim karma according view attachment ego self-cherishing 1
naturally two interpretations completely opposite 1
attachments connotation good bad particular diametrically opposed wisdom 1
confusion lies 1
faith understanding dharma weak youll find easier believe attachments interpretation; faith understanding strong wont find difficult follow wisdoms definition good bad 1
generally speaking common people world large follow attachment 1
good life one success measured external development— accumulation more: wealth possessions cars friends family children grandchildren great-grandchildren forth— external visible signs prosperity 1
according attachment best kind life lead 1
whats behind quest? 1
actually everybody wants peace happiness satisfaction hearts minds 1
thats everybody looking 1
trouble people dont know find 1
method finding fulfillment external development 1
thats know lack dharma education 1
even though want peace mind satisfaction method external one 1
matter always finish rolling stones aptly put it: "i cant get satisfaction 1
say spend years perhaps entire life retreat living monastery nunnery— adhering moral disciplines keeping precepts sacrificing great deal comfort pleasures life order lead pure life 1
haven¥ renounced attachment mind suffer lot 1
point view thats still good life 1
freed mind attachment clinging life separated worldly concerns made mind healthy dont enjoy practices enjoy engaging discipline 1
rather associating virtuous friends good practitioners choose instead stick attachment friends eight worldly dharmas even though physically body may retreat monastery wont experience peace happiness heart 1
long mind friendly attachment clinging life thought eight worldly dharmas able give lifes pleasures comfort order practice dharma follow morality advice virtuous friend offer service monastery monks nuns 1
difficult serve sentient mind stuck attachment instead dharma 1
however even though mind makes hard enjoy life find happiness heart still try practice morality follow monastic discipline supports guides mind protects obstacles still good life 1
similarly trouble staying retreat offering service virtuous friend working sentient beings persevere ensuring life good 1
merit create always bring good results 1
motivated attachment wisdom may find happiness satisfaction heart mind practices keep vows 1
nevertheless still leading good life bring result good rebirth next life 1
even mind completely pure completely renounced completely free thought eight worldly dharmas attachment clinging life completely ascetic result practice definitely good 1
therefore life good one 1
course takes time develop fully renounced mind 1
takes strong continual intensive meditation especially impermanence death related karma sufferings samsara particularly lower realms preceding lam-rim meditations perfect human rebirth: eight freedoms ten richnesses difficulty receiving highly useful difficult find 1
strongly renounced mind behind leave evil thought eight worldly dharmas attachment clinging life greater peace happiness satisfaction find heart 1
similarly extent eight worldly dharmas— praise criticism good reputation bad receiving material things finding happiness comfort problems discomfort— disturb depends extent mind following attachment 1
example cling liked well thought painful find criticized; stronger wish feel comfortable hate discomfort 1
things happen attachment doesnt like— opposites four desirable situations— disturbed get greater pain heart bigger problems appear 1
even though completely renounced attachment clinging life even though heart completely detached evil thought eight worldly dharmas even though dont enjoy monastery nunnery living ordination long try maintain practice still living good life; efforts yield excellent fruit good rebirth next life 1
thats call good life 1
dont see way might decide give up: "oh dharma practice hasnt made happy 1
years studying tibetan buddhism taking teachings qualified lamas living monastery keeping ordination still havent found satisfaction happiness heart 1
perhaps go mosque try islam 1
abandon everything youve try living without rules discipline completely free young guy gal 1
go trying free attachment opposite— living delusion 1
course im generalizing 1
im referring everybody disrobed 1
yet commonly happens people change life 1
still doesnt matter excited much happiness think youve found external pleasures ask yourself: happiness dharma point view point view attachment? 1
analyze experience happiness way 1
even though excited free physical comfort great wealth many friends life motivated uncontrolled mind must consider karmic result 1
dont analyze life according motivation result instead simply look whats going immediate surroundings may appear right; may look like youre enjoying 1
matter firmly believe happy enjoying good life complete hallucination 1
even happiness hallucination 1
dont think motivation future karmic results life seems happy 1
truly happy life one positive motivation positive result 1
point view dharma point view thats happy life 1
naropa milarepa underwent great hardships following gurus orders fantastic futures best futures 1
best possible lives even though bear many difficulties 1
nevertheless cant purify mind one day 1
cant sudden detach attachment clinging life simply living monastery nunnery becoming monk nun 1
takes time 1
happens might bear many hardships 1
dont meditate continuously intensively graduated path practitioner lower capacity especially impermanence death perfect human rebirth never free attachment 1
meantime enjoy living morality keeping ordination adhering monastic disciplines 1
protects mind brings great benefit others 1
course discipline follow ought benefit mind; created purpose 1
thus completely different example military discipline 1
disciplines followed great monasteries sera ganden drepung upper lower tantric colleges devised incredibly learned holy beings order benefit minds adhered disciplines order develop minds path enlightenment 1
sentient beings benefit practicing morality abstaining harming 1
aims monastic discipline 1
therefore living conditions even though part mind might telling style life brings happiness satisfaction recollect results practice bring 1
since abiding morality killing stealing forth know good karmic result experience happiness future 1
therefore even though dont feel happiness heart right sure future 1
thats main point trying emphasize 1
days however especially west goal seems "does make happy right now? 1
thats main goal: happy 1
right moment today 1
top comes old-style psychology cherishing pumping feel important daily affirmation forth 1
however best way taking care best way loving practice dharma 1
practice dharma rejecting rather looking best possible way 1
develop renunciation liberating samsara 1
thats exactly need: without liberation experience suffering continuously without end 1
meditating emptiness also best way taking care yourself: developing right view cut root samsara 1
need mention generating bodhicitta leads ultimate happiness enlightenment 1
beyond three principal aspects path else need? 1
better left do? 1
higher goals achieve? 1
could possibly better liberation samsara enlightenment? 1
better way taking care yourself? 1
whenever practice dharma daily lives taking care best possible way 1
holiness dalai lama often says youre going selfish smart 1
means want happy serve others benefit others avoid giving harm 1
thats best way ensuring happiness making life successful 1
holiness means talks "wise selfishness 1
im saying similar 1
without practice dharma happiness; without practice dharma never happy 1
therefore best way find happiness best way take care best way look practice dharma 1
whenever practice dharma collect virtue; infallible result virtue happiness— lifes happiness happiness many lives come 1
karma certain; good karma definitely brings happiness 1
methods happiness dharma unreliable 1
actually dharma methods happiness 1
never achieve happiness method dharma 1
dharma non-virtue possible result suffering 1
therefore whenever practice dharma daily lives really taking care best possible way really loving 1
possible result happiness 1
even attitude simply seeking happiness yourself— better future lives liberation samsara— still taking care leading good life 1
offering service sentient beings finding happiness life mind impure yet conquered ego attachment yet renounced samsara least working others 1
long working happiness sentient beings still leading good life 1
still might feel "im enjoying life; heart isnt happy" "my motivation impure" result stop working others 1
go something else something benefits neither others lose even small benefit offering others efforts body speech mind life becomes complete waste time 1
compare two: totally wasting life something beneficial others even impure motivation 1
becomes useful others youre still living good life; others receive happiness 1
stop instead something benefit whatsoever completely waste energy body speech mind 1
everything spent food shelter medicine clothing time born present rendered completely useless; didnt benefit didnt benefit others 1
waste everything done also waste everything parents 1
years time conception present sacrificed lives look 1
worked hard point exhaustion great concern fear worry welfare 1
spend life something brings benefit others parents efforts completely wasted 1
therefore rejoice met precious buddhadharma especially lam-rim integrates entire collection 84000 teachings buddha coherent whole allows us practice without confusion attain supreme goal enlightenment 1
practicing lam-rim purifying negative karma obscurations accumulating merit example reciting vajrasattva mantra names powerful deities eradicate wrong conceptions complete realizations path especially bodhicitta work perfectly sentient beings 1
every day listening reflecting meditating lam-rim benefit lives enormously 1
reading lam-rim teachings even minutes seconds plant seed enlightenment minds 1
moments reading also bringing great benefit sentient beings 1
apart meditating path also offer service sentient beings many ways 1
question therefore rejoice 1
going back commentary "… matter happens life pure impure" means must take refuge times 1
broken vows even precept-holder created ten non-virtuous actions negative karma still need take refuge 1
fact times take refuge even 1
cant think "ive created negative karma im hopeless" give stop practicing dharma 1
still want happiness; still dont want suffering 1
therefore times take refuge strongly ever 1
whatever happens life pure evil good bad happiness suffering take refuge— mouth merely words bottom heart beseech guru triple gem "please guide right 1
thought mind recite "i sentient beings without exception equaling limitless sky…" forth 1
verse shows us take strong refuge 1
pray words come mouth feel heart harmony 1
say feel identical; must abide meaning words 1
main point ive trying say long living ordination monastery nunnery even though may find happiness satisfaction heart life still worthwhile; still good life result good karma creating happiness future lives 1
one life many future lives 1
even though find life difficult feel sacrificed lot comfort pleasure dharma practice definitely ensure good future 1
long run receive much happiness good rebirths liberation enlightenment 1
therefore even find difficult practice enjoy please become discouraged 1
dharma teachingsthe buddhadharma true source happiness sentient beings 1
books like show put teachings practice integrate life whereby get happiness seek 1
therefore anything containing dharma teachings names teachers precious material objects treated respect 1
avoid creating karma meeting dharma future lives please put books holy objects floor underneath stuff step sit upon use mundane purposes propping wobbly tables 1
kept clean high place separate worldly writings wrapped cloth carried around 1
need get rid dharma materials thrown rubbish burned special way 1
briefly: incinerate materials trash alone burn recite mantra om ah hum 1
smoke rises visualize pervades space carrying essence dharma sentient beings six samsaric realms purifying minds alleviating suffering bringing happiness including enlightenment 1
people might find practice bit unusual given according tradition 1
thank much 1
dedication merit created preparing reading thinking sharing book others may teachers dharma live long healthy lives may dharma spread throughout infinite reaches space may sentient beings quickly attain enlightenment 1
whichever realm country area place book may may war drought famine disease injury disharmony unhappiness may great prosperity may everything needed easily obtained may guided perfectly qualified dharma teachers enjoy happiness dharma may love compassion may benefit never harm 1

classifications largelynot entirely means tibetan ways organizing varied teachings 1
instance tibetans use term vaibhasika refer original 18 schools include theravada 1
reality 18 schools often distinctive ideas consider one 1
pointed abhidharma teachings theravada quite bit different abhidharmakosa 1
term vaibhasika used vasubandhu restricted one 18 schools existed kasmir produced work called mahavibhasa great commentary 1
work exists chinese never translated tibetan 1
information nature see jeffrey hopkins chapter tibetan doxography tibetan literature studies genre newly published snow lion 1
way wrote chapter 27 little plug 1
tibetans consider study four systems like progressive meditation definition selflessness becomes subtler subtler schools serve bridge ladder 1
notion way reinforced hevajra tantra explicitly advises one progress fashion 1
also pointed number differences systems regarding path idea final vehicle etc 1
besides view concerning selflessness ultimate truth 1
run see geshe sopa jeffrey hopkins cutting appearances 1
argument selflessness simple structure found tenet systems 1
something truly exists inherently exists must findable either direct perception inference 1
process like search chemistry physics basic units matter 1
something demonstrated capable broken isnt basic unit 1
tenet systems regard analysis self follow basic approach 1
sets apart number issues degree claimed basic unit established 1
purpose performing exercise winning debates playing intellectual games 1
point reiterated countless times masters 1
tsongkapa whose reputation scholar agreed including opponents first order said work taken way game would failed 1
rather exercise meant explore minds way grasping unreal real 1
grasping takes place level much deeper verbalization discursive thought 1
however use thought nonetheless gain better insight 1
done systems whether system elaborate rather simple still done 1
even instruction sit says something used get something deeper 1
said -- vaibhasika sautrantika classed together since views self selflessness essentially 1
tenet systems assert selflessness person dharmas 1
self say mere designation imputed upon skandhas 1
vasubandhu says:how know word soul designation series skandhas soul exists itself? 1
know proof establishes existence soul apart skandhas proof direct perception proof inference 1
soul real entity separate like entities would known 1
basically look self given time find something else part skandhas feeling individual thought whatever 1
find something totally apart units dharmas constitutes generally call self 1
self different skandhas able remove skandhas find 1
hasnt happened 1
self equivalent skandhas soon skandhas changed bit would disappear doesnt 1
ergo self imputed skandhas 1
note said self doesnt exist rather mode existence basic unit generally take 1
example: take pot favorite buddhist example pot perceived sitting table 1
smash pieces pot longer appears 1
thought pot merely designation imputed upon collection multiple units matter 1
think terms general particular sautrantika philosophy generals universals etc 1
like conventional truth particular ultimate truth 1
vaibhasika sautrantika particulars basic units called dharmas 1
vaibhasikas divided five skandhas 72 dharmas 1

passing yogacara words: vaibhasika sautrantika referred hinayana schools yogacara madhyamika mahayana 1
however examination true mainly point view main expositors 1
vai/sau recognized path bodhisattva theravada perfectly legitimate one outlined path bodhisattva would take become buddha 1
however bodhisattvas wisdom took/takes view respective philosophies 1
bodhisattva basically puts nirvana works benefit beings merit acquires 10 powers buddha held sravakas pratyekas 1
similarly within yogacara madhyamika arhats pratyeka buddhas yogacara madhyamika viewpoints simply meditate emptiness point cultivate perfections work buddhahood 1
stop short 1
gelug call mahayanist holding hinayana tenets vice versa 1
think might better say simply tenet systems certain independence vehicle 1
defining characteristic 1
course little complex short version 1
number different subgroups like true aspectarians false aspectarians 1
also spectrum degree idealism asserted 1
also although alaya vijnana held many key yogacara tenet considered yogacara assert six conscioussnesses denying alaya klista vijnana 1
instance dharmakirti held gelug example latter 1
see cutting appearances sopa hopkins run different groupings yogacara well tenet systems 1
scope purposes going limit primarily asanga using tatvartha chapter bodhisattvabhumi mahayana sangraha 1
madhyamika yogacara said mahayana tenet systems 1

100000 versed version tones rhetoric little saying things ultimately empty empty 1
nagarjuna states many places emptiness nothingness dependent origination/arising 1

without inherent/independent could cause effect path etc 1
sometime nagarjuna buddhapalita used form reasoning called prasanga demonstrate nagarjunas point 1
prasanga consequence 1
one takes opposing thesis demonstrate consequences 1
another madhyamika bhavaviveka criticized technique saying effect anargument successful full syllogism consequence 1
bhavavivekas method called svatantra 1
illustrate without giving full lesson indian logic would lose everybody:sound impermanent product 1
word product called sign 1
basis inferential valid cognition created 1
sign modes relating elements syllogism 1
property subject 1
sound product product property sound 1
forward pervasion: product member set impairment phenomenacounterpervasion: negative product pervaded negative sign 1
permanent phenomena non-products 1
svatantra contains three modes 1
prasanga contains last two 1
argument indians saw method best suitable persuade someone 1
important keep mind india purpose arguing persuasion 1
later chandrakirti defended buddhapalitas method quite strongly 1
follow chandras method called prasangikas 1
bhavaviveka following method called svatantrikas 1
terms developed later apply two methods 1
persons saw madhyamika 1
tibet madhyamika first introduced shantiraksita considered svatantrika 1
method later persons called yogacara-madhyamika recommended meditating first things mind using method similar yogacaras meditate mind empty inherent existence 1
method became extremely popular tibet 1
chandras writings introduced later time 1
next final post presenting tsongkapas1357-1419 interpretation prasangika madhyamika superior svatantra noting arguments tibetan scholars disagree 1
first let explain trained gelug 1
obviously interpretation 1
lineages differing views madhyamika important 1
think views differ greatly dont 1
belong latter 1
encourage heart persons stimulated feel benefited series study 1
tsongkhapa felt cause bound samsara deeply rooted habit grasped concept inherent existence 1
exist inherently means basis independent imputation 1
tsongkhapa argued essence tenet systems prasangika asserted basis either explicitly 1
said one find stated implicitly may hard find passage question conclusion might drawn things 1
case vaibhasika sautrantika dharmas 1
yogacara paratantra parinispanna mind 1
madhyamikas argued basis ultimately 1
svatantrikas however used syllogisms instead consequences implicitly asserted type independence conventional level known svalaksana inherent characteristic 1
extremely subtle 1
argument syllogism used assumption two parties see first mode property subject way implying sort independent existence 1
seeing property way demands recognizing property minimum sort characteristic independent imputing mind 1
use consequence merely takes assumption opponent basis opposed making assumption oneself 1
therefore prasangika fault asserting iherent existence/characteristic even conventionally 1
scholars tibet hold tsongkhapas differentiation incorrect since sautrantikas assert svalaksana ultimately use conventionally means lead persons truth hold view 1
argue indians view svatantrikas prasangikas way tsongkhapa rather seemed agree difference pedagogical 1
say svatantra converting non-buddhists prasanga converting buddhists 1
tsongkhapas point though however intent history issue even grasping something subtle done away 1
tsongkhapa agreed chandra inherent existence didnt exist even conventionally 1
conventional world people use words agree things unanalytic way 1
say jamyang 1
dont say inherent jamyang 1
negating inherent existence one allows convention incompatibility samsara nirvana form emptiness 1
inherent existence negated left dependent arising 1
everything pure 1
negation inherent existence intended arrow shoot root cause defilement 1
cuts core grasped 1
things appear mirage reflection plantain tree bubble etc 1
play stainless mind wind 1
sarva mangalamprecious bodhicitta arisen may arise 1
arisen may decline grow ever fuller 1
merit presentation may beings obtain state vajradhara 1
may dharma take solid root west may obstacles arise practice flourishing 1
