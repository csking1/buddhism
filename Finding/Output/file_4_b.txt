0.018182, daar onze eenige kans op levensbehoud gelegen de sloepen van de abraham lincoln besloten wij dus pogingen het werk te stellen om ons zoo lang mogelijk boven water te houden ten einde ze af te wachten ik stelde dus voor om onze krachten te verdeelen ten einde ze niet gelijktijdig uit te putten en zi0.019231, ehier wat wij besloten terwijl een van ons beiden onbeweeglijk met elkander gekruiste armen en gestrekte beenen op den rug zou liggen zou de ander zwemmen en hem voorwaarts duwen wij zouden elk niet meer dan tien minuten die rol van sleper vervullen en als wij elkander aldus aflosten zouden wij nog0.090909,  uren lang misschien wel tot den morgen toe kunnen boven blijven

0.066667, "neen mijnheer aronnax het laat zich door de golven voortwiegelen maar het beweegt zich niet"
0.021277, maar het moeielijk om zich bij het verdoovende geraas van de schroef te doen verstaan gelukkig zonk het vaartuig niet dieper plotseling hoorde ik een gekraak van sterk knarsende sloten binnen het vaartuig eene plaat werd opgelicht een man verscheen gaf een zonderlingen kreet en verdween oogenblikke0.050001, lijk eenige oogenblikken later verschenen er acht sterke klanten met bedekt gelaat en sleepten ons hunne vervaarlijke machine naar beneden
0.142857, "bedaar vriend ned bedaar" antwoordde koenraad kalm
0.019608, ik liep al tastende vooruit na vijf zes stap stiet ik tegen een ijzeren muur van platen met bouten vastgeklonken toen ik mij omkeerde voelde ik eene houten tafel waarbij verscheiden bankjes stonden de vloer bedekt met eene dikke mat welke het geluid onzer schreden verdoofde aan de naakte wanden voe0.018868, lde ik niets wat op deur venster geleek koenraad die langs den tegenovergestelden kant rondgetast kwam weder bij mij waaruit het ons bleek dat de hut zoo wat twintig voet lang en tien voet breed zijn moest wat de hoogte aangaat ned land kon hoewel hij nog al lang den zolder niet bereiken

0.250000, "zeker" antwoordde de harpoenier

0.023256, "zeer goed de paradijsvogels verliezen den oostmousson hunne prachtige staartveeren deze worden door de namakers van vogels opgezocht en aan een te voren verminkten papegaai aangeplakt dan verven en vernissen zij den vogel en sturen die voortbrengselen hunner zonderlinge nijverheid naar de europees0.250000, che museums aan liefhebbers"
0.250000, hij hoorde mij niet
0.500000, "maar kapitein"
0.019608, ik bleef gedurende eenige uren dan dacht ik aan die inboorlingen zonder ze te vreezen want het onwrikbare vertrouwen van den kapitein zich ook van mij meester gemaakt dan vergat ik ze weer om de pracht van den sterrenhemel deze tropische gewesten te bewonderen ik vloog gedachten met die sterren wel0.019231, ke mijn vaderland binnen weinige uren zouden verlichten naar frankrijk mede de maan schitterde aan het uitspansel ik dacht er aan dat die trouwe wachter overmorgen op die zelfde plaats terug zou komen om het water te doen rijzen en de nautilus van de koraalklip los te maken toen ik tegen middernach0.018868, t zag dat alles op zee en onder het geboomte op de kust rustig ging ik naar mijne hut en sliep kalm de nacht ging zonder ongeval voorbij de papoea's waren zonder twijfel bang voor het monster dat de baai lag want het geopende luik zou hun anders gemakkelijk den toegang verschaft hebben
0.090910, "zoo" zeide de kapitein bedaard "zijn zij met hunne prauwen gekomen"
0.100000, "denkt gij dan mijnheer dat zij aan boord zullen komen"
0.022728, den volgenden dag 10 januari hervatte de nautilus haar tocht weer onder water maar met zulk eene snelheid dat ik haar op niet minder dan 35 kilometer het uur schatte de snelheid van de schroef zoo groot dat ik de omwentelingen niet tellen kon
0.019232, maar de nautilus niets met die leelijke dieren uit te staan timor voor een oogenblik slechts zichtbaar namelijk om twaalf uur toen de eerste stuurman de hoogte der zon nam ook zag ik slechts even het kleine eiland rotti dat tot dezelfde groep behoort en welks vrouwen op de maleische slavenmarkten e0.166667, en grooten naam van schoonheid bezitten
0.125000, "o" dacht ik "hij waagt zich die zee"
0.020000, het acht uur 's morgens een half uur daarna waren wij voor onze nieuwe wandeling gereed en voorzien van licht en ademhalingstoestellen de dubbele deuren werden geopend en gezelschap van den kapitein die door een twaalftal mannen gevolgd werd stonden wij weldra op tien meter diepte op den vasten bod0.020408, em waarop ook de nautilus lag eene lichte helling voerde ons naar een heuvelachtig terrein dat op vijftien vademen diepte lag dit geheel verschillend van de streek welke wij bij onzen eersten tocht gezien hadden hier geen fijn zand geen onderzeesch weiland geen woud van zeeplanten ik herkende onmid0.066667, dellijk de verwonderlijke streek waar kapitein nemo ons zou rondleiden het het rijk der koralen
0.021739, onze toestellen van ruhmkorff werden orde gebracht en wij volgden eene koraalbank welke nog bezig met zich te vormen en eens mettertijd dit gedeelte van den indischen oceaan zal afsluiten onze weg omzoomd met onuitroeibare struiken welke gevormd werden door heesters die met witte stervormige bloeme0.038462, n als bezaaid werden echter groeiden die heesters tegenstelling van de planten op het vaste land van boven naar beneden en zaten aan de rotsen vast
0.066667, "ja mijnheer" antwoordde kapitein nemo ernstig "buiten het bereik der haaien en der menschen" [3]
0.500000, westelijk halfrond
0.020834, wij doorkliefden toen de golven van den indischen oceaan die een oppervlakte van 550 millioen hectaren beslaat en wiens water zoo helder dat men er duizelig van wordt als men daarin neerkijkt de nautilus dreef gewoonlijk tusschen honderd en tweehonderd meter diepte dit duurde zoo eenige dagen voor 0.020000, iemand die niet zooals ik ontzaglijk veel van de zee hield zouden de uren langzaam en eentonig zijn voorbijgegaan maar die dagelijksche wandelingen op het plat waar wij de verfrisschende lucht van den oceaan inademden het schouwspel van de rijkbevolkte zee door het glas van den salon het lezen van 0.045455, boeken uit de bibliotheek het aanhouden van mijn dagboek dat alles hield mij steeds bezig en liet mij geen oogenblik verveling gevoelen
0.100000, "welnu mijnheer kan men dit niet zonder zijn vergunning doen"
0.333333, "zonder twijfel kapitein"
0.027778, "zeer slecht mijnheer de professor te panama verdienen zij maar een rijksdaalder per week meestal krijgen zij twee en een halven cent voor een oester die parels bevat en hoeveel zijn er niet waar niets inzit"
0.100000, "zeg eens mijnheer aronnax zijt gij niet bang voor haaien"
0.029412, "als mijnheer het niet kwalijk neemt" antwoordde koenraad "de kapitein van den nautilus heeft ons uitgenoodigd om morgen mijnheers gezelschap de prachtige parelvisscherij van ceylon te bezoeken hij heeft dit zoo beleefd mogelijk gedaan"
0.250000, "o veel zeer veel"
0.021277, de kapitein het dus zeker onnoodig gevonden om bij mijn makkers het denkbeeld aan haaien op te wekken ik keek hen verwarring aan alsof zij reeds een van hunne ledematen misten moest ik hen waarschuwen ja zeker maar ik wist niet goed hoe ik dit zou aanleggen
0.250000, "mijnheer wat een parel"
0.062500, "zei ik haaien" vroeg ik driftig "ik wil zeggen honderd vijftig parels haaien zou bespottelijk zijn"
0.125000, "aan boord nergens toe" zei ned "maar elders"
0.111111, "neen" antwoordde ik "vooral wanneer men zekere voorzorgsmaatregelen neemt"
0.038462, de kapitein geleidde mij naar de groote trap en kwam met mij op het plat waar ned land en koenraad vol verrukking het "pleziertochtje" reeds wachtten
0.035714, "welnu wij zullen dan terugkeeren ned en als de nautilus daarna de roode zee bezoekt bestaat de straat van babelmandeb toch nog altijd om ons door te laten"
0.022222, de roode zee heeft een lengte van 2600 kilometer en gemiddeld 240 kilometer breed den tijd van de en der romeinsche keizers zij de groote slagader van den wereldhandel en de doorgraving der landlengte van suez heeft haar de belangrijkheid van vroeger eeuwen geheel teruggegeven
0.022727, de andere plantdieren die naast de sponsachtige leefden bestonden voornamelijk zeer fraaie soorten van zeekwallen onder de weekdieren merkte ik onderscheidene soorten van calmars blakvisschen op die volgens d'orbigny aan de roode zee bepaald eigen zijn gelijk ook onder de kruipende dieren de schilp0.052632, adden die den bijnaam virgala hebben en tot de soorten behooren die een gezochte voedzame en smakelijke spijze opleveren
0.031250, "ja het een purperkleurige slijmachtige stof voortgebracht door kleine plantjes waarvan er 40000 noodig zijn om een kubieken millimeter te vullen misschien zult gij er wel zien als wij bij tor komen"
0.200000, "maar waarom verwondert het u"
0.083333, "en wie zegt u dat wij om afrika heengaan mijnheer de professor
0.076923, "wie spreekt er van om langs de kaap de goede hoop te varen"
0.111111, "ik luister kapitein doch kan het haast niet gelooven"
0.035714, inderdaad het zwarte voorwerp weldra geen vier kilometer meer van ons af het geleek op een groote klip midden zee wat het ik kon het nog niet zeggen
0.071429, "is zulk een dugong dan gevaarlijk" vroeg ik niettegenstaande het minachtend schouderophalen van ned
0.066667, "welnu mijnheer de natuurkenner" vroeg de amerikaan op spottenden toon "waar nu de middellandsche zee"
0.166667, "goed mijnheer aronnax dat verstandig gesproken"
0.062500, "wij zullen wel eens zien" antwoordde ned land die met een vastberaden gelaat het hoofd schudde
0.200000, "waar zijn wij" vroeg ik
0.076923, "ik dacht" zei ik "dat de vorming van deze nieuwe eilanden afgeloopen was"
0.032258, ik geloof dat toen wij de adriatische zee voorbijvoeren ik ook twee drie potvisschen heb gezien koen meende dolfijnen en zeekalven en zelfs een voet zes lange schildpad te hebben opgemerkt
0.125000, "ja ned hij moest bij zijn bankier zijn"
0.018182, wat mij aangaat ik troostte mij spoedig ik voelde mij als bevrijd van een last die mij drukte en ik kon met betrekkelijke kalmte mijn gewone werk weer opvatten des avonds te elf uur ontving ik onverwacht een bezoek van kapitein nemo hij vroeg mij zeer beleefd ik moede van het waken gedurende den vo0.200000, rigen nacht ik antwoordde ontkennend
0.031250, "ik zeg u dat die wandeling zeer vermoeiend zal zijn gij moet lang loopen en een berg beklimmen en de wegen zijn niet zoo bijzonder goed onderhouden" voegde hij er glimlachend bij
0.142857, "o kapitein" antwoordde ik "waar zijn wij"
0.019231, op enkele bochten van ons pad vertoonde zich het meer zijn geheele uitgestrektheid het werd door de lantaarn van den nautilus verlicht en wij zagen er geen enkel golfje rimpeltje op de nautilus lag onbeweeglijk op het plat liepen menschen heen en weer als zwarte schimmen de zee van het electrisch l0.018519, icht op dat oogenblik draaiden wij om een uitstekend rotspunt heen en zagen toen dat de bijen niet de eenige dieren waren die den vulkaan bewoonden roofvogels vlogen hier en daar de duisternis rond vluchtten weg van hun nesten het waren sperwers en havikken ook liepen er hier en daar zoo snel zij k0.020000, onden schoone en vette trapganzen men kan zich de begeerlijkheid van den amerikaan voorstellen toen hij dit smakelijk wild zag en welk een spijt hij gevoelde zijn geweer niet bij zich te hebben hij beproefde ze met steenen te raken en na verscheidene vruchtelooze pogingen slaagde hij er eindelijk e0.027778, en van die prachtige trapganzen te treffen als ik zeg dat hij twintigmaal zijn leven waagde om het dier te grijpen jok ik niet maar hij vervolgde het beest zoo lang totdat hij het zijn zak
0.020000, drie kwartier daarna hadden wij onzen tocht om het meer en waren wij weer aan boord de mannen der equipage brachten op dat oogenblik de laatste vracht sodium binnen boord zoodat de nautilus aanstonds kunnen vertrekken doch de kapitein gaf daartoe geen bevel wilde hij daartoe den nacht afwachten en 0.027778, heimelijk door de onderzeesche opening varen misschien hoe het ook zij den volgenden morgen de nautilus zijn verlaten en voer ver van elk vast land op eenige meters voort onder de golven van den atlantischen oceaan
0.019231, op deze wijze met de grootste kracht voortgestuwd trilde de nautilus als een snaar en daalde regelmatig naar de diepte de kapitein en ik volgden den salon de naald van den manometer die zich vrij snel verplaatste weldra waren wij dieper dan dat gedeelte der zee waar de meeste visschen hun verblijf 0.020408, houden terwijl sommigen van die dieren slechts aan de oppervlakte van het water kunnen leven zijn er daarentegen anderen hoewel minder talrijk die zich grootere diepte ophouden er waren er zelfs op 1200 meter diepte onder een druk van honderd twintig atmosferen ik vroeg den kapitein hij ooit vissch0.166667, en op nog grooter laagte gevonden
0.022223, terwijl wij rakelings langs de rotsen voeren zag ik nog eenige schelpen en sommige exemplaren van zeesterren maar weldra verdwenen ook deze laatste vertegenwoordigers van het dierlijk leven en op grooter diepte dan twaalf kilometer overschreed de nautilus de grenzen van het onderzeesche leven even 0.022222, als een luchtballon die zich de lucht hooger dan de voor het leven geschikte dampkring verheft wij hadden een diepte van zestien kilometer bereikt de nautilus onderging een druk van 1600 atmosferen dat te zeggen van 1600 kilogram op elken vierkanten centimeter van zijn oppervlakte
0.500000, hoofdstuk xxxvi
0.090909, "nooit mijnheer alleen de noordelijke ijszee zoowel de behring als davisstraten"
0.111111, "en men bouwt er huizen op" zei koenraad lachende
0.043478, "jawel grappenmaker" antwoordde ned land "en dan op een mooien dag duikt het beest en sleept al wat er op mee naar beneden"
0.200000, "en waarom zegt men dat"
0.023256, koenraad zijn volzin nog niet toen ned land al door het luik naar beneden sprong om den kapitein te zoeken eenige oogenblikken daarna verschenen beiden op het plat kapitein nemo beschouwde den troep walvisschen die op een kilometer afstand van den nautilus dartelden
0.031250, ned land floot de yankeedoodle stak de handen de zakken en keerde ons den rug toe kapitein nemo bleef evenwel den troep walvisschen bekijken en zei terwijl hij zich tot mij richtte
0.032258, "wacht maar mijnheer aronnax" zei de kapitein "wij zullen u op een jachtpartij onthalen die u nog niet kent geen medelijden met die woeste visschen het zijn enkel bek en tanden"
0.020000, bek en tanden men kon den grootkoppigen soms vijf en twintig meter langen potvisch geen beteren naam geven de verbazend groote kop van dit monster vormt ongeveer een derde deel van zijn lichaam flinker gewapend dan de walvisch wiens bovenkaak alleen met baarden voorzien heeft hij vijf en twintig gr0.020833, oote tanden twintig centimeter lang kegelvormig en elk twee kilo wegend het bovendeel van den kop tusschen de kraakbeenderen bevinden zich drie vier honderd kilo van de kostbaarste blanke traan de potvisch een wanstaltig dier eerder zoogdier dan een visch hij slecht gebouwd en vooral aan den linker0.090910, kant geheel misvormd terwijl hij alleen met het rechteroog kan zien
0.021739, de strijd tusschen walvisschen en potvisschen reeds begonnen toen de nautilus er bij kwam het vaartuig sneed den troep potvisschen af deze waren eerst niet zeer verwonderd de verschijning van een nieuw monster dat zich den strijd mengde doch moesten zich weldra voor zijn slagen vrijwaren
0.023256, welk een slachting wat een geweld aan de oppervlakte van den oceaan wat lieten de ontstelde dieren een scherp geblaas en een bijzonder gebrul hooren 't midden van deze gewoonlijk zoo kalme zee zweepten zij met den staart het water hooge golven op
0.016667, kapitein nemo liet den nautilus naast het dier sturen twee man der equipage gingen op den visch staan en ik zag niet zonder verbazing dat zij uit de tepels van het dier al de melk haalden welke er dat te zeggen zoo wat twee drie tonnen vol de kapitein bood mij een kop van die lauwe melk aan ik kon 0.019608, eenigen afkeer van dien vreemden drank niet ontveinzen hij verzekerde mij dat de melk voortreffelijk en er geen onderscheid met koemelk te proeven ik proefde dus en moest hem gelijk geven het dus voor ons een nuttige aanwinst want die melk maakte den vorm van boter en kaas een aangename afwisseling0.250003,  met onze gewone spijzen
0.020000, ik begreep dat dit voor ned land evenals voor alle zeevaarders die ons voor waren gegaan een onoverkomelijke hinderpaal toen de zon tegen den namiddag een oogenblik verscheen nam kapitein nemo vrij nauwkeurig onze hoogte wij waren op 30' lengte en 30' breedte het deze zuidelijke een vrij ver gevord0.020408, erd punt van een zee er evenwel niets te zien den nautilus strekte zich een groote vlakte uit bezaaid met grillig gevormde ijsblokken de zonderlinge wanorde die het bevroren vlak eener rivier kenmerkt eenigen tijd voordat zij aan het kruien gaat maar hier veel geduchter afmetingen zooals zich laat 0.020409, "welnu mijnheer" hervatte de amerikaan "laat dat denkbeeld varen gij ligt hier voor die ijsbank laat u dat genoeg zijn want gij noch uw kapitein nemo noch zijn nautilus kunnen verder en hij wil niet hij zal naar het noorden dat naar het land der fatsoenlijke menschen moeten terugkeeren"
0.083333, "nog verder naar het zuiden" vroeg ik terwijl ik den kapitein aankeek
0.249999, "hebt gij die nog"
0.030303, tegen twee uur den morgen ging ik eenige uren rust nemen koenraad deed hetzelfde toen ik door de gangen ging ontmoette ik den kapitein niet ik veronderstelde dat hij aan het roer stond
0.022222, "tot morgen" zei de kapitein bedaard en wij roeiden weer naar den nautilus onze afwezigheid men de netten uitgeworpen en ik beschouwde met belangstelling de visschen die men deze zuidelijke poolzee gevangen de zuidelijke poolzee de wijkplaats voor een groote menigte trekvisschen die de keerkringsst0.020833, ormen ontwijken maar om de prooi te worden van bruinvisschen en robben ik zag er eenige kraakbeenachtige schaaldieren van een decimeter lengte witachtig met blauwe en bruine vlekken gewapend met angels voorts een wonderlijk soort van zeedieren drie voet lang met rank lichaam een gladde witte huid m0.035714, et zilveren weerschijn drie rugvinnen een ronden kop wier muil uitloopt een omgebogen snuit ik proefde er van maar vond ze zeer onsmakelijk koen daarentegen prees ze zeer
0.333333, "hij heeft gelijk"
0.020000, en wij beklommen de zwarte rotsen waarbij dikwijls onverwacht groote steenen naar beneden vielen terwijl het ijs ons pad hier en daar vrij glad maakte ik viel meermalen en bezeerde mij dan erg koenraad voorzichtiger stond vaster op zijn beenen ten minste hij struikelde bijna niet en hielp mij telke0.041667, ns op waarbij hij zeide "als mijnheer zoo goed wilde zijn om zijn beenen verder van elkaar te zetten zou mijnheer beter blijven staan"
0.090909, ik deelde mijn opmerkingen en mijn vrees aan den kapitein mede
0.041667, ik onderscheidde ook lange schoolen visschen tot de klasse der kabeljauwen behoorende benevens groote troepen weekdieren en zeekwallen wiegelende tusschen de kammen der golfjes
0.019608, ik wilde met den amerikaan niet gaan twisten en antwoordde derhalve niet bovendien openden zich op dit oogenblik de zijwanden en viel het electrisch licht naar binnen wij waren het ruime sop maar op tien meter afstand verhief zich aan elke zij van den nautilus een schitterende ijsmuur dit boven en 0.020409, onder ons evenzeer het geval boven ons want de onderzijde der ijsbank vormde een reuzengewelf onder ons omdat de losgeraakte ijsberg bij zijn rijzen gestuit tegen een paar naar beneden uitstekende wanden en dus een vasten stand ingenomen de nautilus bewoog zich nu een tunnel van ijs het gemakkelijk0.033334,  om er uit te komen hetzij het vaartuig voor achteruit ging om dan later weer eenige honderden meters dieper vaarwater den vrijen tocht onder de ijsbank door voort te zetten
0.083333, "wat komen er eenige uren op aan als wij er maar uitkomen"
0.111111, "welnu kapitein dan moeten wij dien tijd bevrijd zijn"
0.037037, toen ned aangekleed ging ik naar den salon terug waar de wanden geopend waren en naast koenraad staande bekeek ik de ijsmuren eens waartusschen de nautilus lag
0.034483, "zonder nog te rekenen dat als wij uit die vervloekte gevangenis verlost zijn" zei ned "wij dan nog onder de ijsbank zitten en geen gemeenschap hebben met de buitenlucht"
0.025641, ik deelde mijn makkers dit nieuw gevaar niet mede waarom behoefde ik de geestkracht uit te dooven die zij voor hun reddingswerk zoozeer noodig hadden doch toen ik weer aan boord kwam deelde ik den kapitein deze omstandigheden mede
0.066667, de eersten te zijn ik mij toch reeds moeten gewennen aan die wijzen van spreken
0.142857, "wij kunnen het probeeren" zei ik vastberaden
0.062500, maar hoelang zou die vaart onder de ijsbank nog duren nog een dag dan ik dood
0.062500, het luik werd geopend liever losgerukt en de lucht drong alle deelen van ons vaartuig door
0.029412, "het de moeite niet waard om er te spreken mijnheer" zei ned land "welke verdienste steekt erin niets het maar een berekening uw leven meer waard dan het onze wij moesten het uwe redden"
0.058824, "ja" zei ik "omdat wij naar den zonnekant gaan en waar zich de zon bevindt het noorden"
0.020408, gedurende twee dagen voeren wij door dit onbevolkt en diep water maar den 11den april verhief het vaartuig zich plotseling en wij zagen wederom land den omtrek van de monding der amazonenrivier die zulk een breede zoutwatergolf vormt dat de zee verscheidene kilometers ver die monding geen zout wate0.500000, r bevat
0.021277, zonder zich aan die theorie te storen ving de bemanning van den nautilus een half dozijn van die dieren omdat hun vleesch een heerlijken voorraad voor de kombuis opleverde veel lekkerder dan kalf rundvleesch deze jacht alles behalve belangwekkend omdat die zeekoeien zich zonder tegenstand laten doo0.076923, den verscheiden duizenden kilogrammen vleesch werden aan boord gebracht om gedroogd te worden
0.020001, toen de vangst afgeloopen naderde de nautilus de kust hier lag een groot aantal zeeschildpadden op de golven te slapen het zou moeielijk zijn geweest zich van die dieren meester te maken omdat het minste geritsel ze doet ontwaken en hun stevige schaal ondoordringbaar voor den harpoen ze werden even0.020000, wel gevangen door middel van zuigervisschen dien men een ring met een koord aan den staart vastmaakte toen deze visschen zee werden geworpen begonnen zij aanstonds hun werk en hechtten zich aan den buik der schildpadden vast zij klemden zich zoo aan dat zij zich eerder zouden hebben laten verscheur0.019608, en dan loslaten men trok ze weer naar boord en daarmee de schildpadden waar zij zich aan vast hadden gehecht men ving er op die wijze verscheidene die een meter breed waren en 200 kilo wogen de schaal groote dunne bruine en doorschijnende vakken afgedeeld maakte ze nog kostbaarder bovendien leverde0.166667, n zij een voortreffelijke spijs op
0.062500, "ontwijfelbaar wakkere ned ook heeft men daarom voorgesteld dien inktvisch 'de inktvisch van bouguer' te noemen"
0.249999, "ik neem die aan"
0.062500, "wij zullen u vergezellen" zei ik en den kapitein volgend begaven wij ons naar de middeltrap
0.020408, een noodlottige omstandigheid echter werkte de plannen van den amerikaan tegen het weder zeer slecht wij waren die streken waar stormen dikwijls voorkomen en de cyclonen ontstaan die door den golfstroom worden veroorzaakt het een zeker verderf loopen zich een kleine boot op zulk een zee te wagen ne0.040002, d land moest dit bekennen derhalve kropte hij zijn leed op want hij een hevigen aanval van heimwee waarvan de vlucht hem alleen kunnen genezen
0.020409, het geduld van den amerikaan blijkbaar ten einde zijn krachtige natuur kon zich aan deze langdurige gevangenschap niet gewennen zijn gezicht veranderde bij den dag zijn karakter werd hoe langer hoe somberder ik gevoelde wat hij lijden moest want ik begon ook heimwee te krijgen er waren bijna zeven 0.020000, maanden verloopen zonder dat wij iets van het land hadden gehoord bovendien begon ik de zaken op geheel andere wijze te beschouwen nu de kapitein zich zoo afzonderde en zijn humeur vooral sedert den strijd met de inktvisschen zoo veranderd ik gevoelde niet meer dezelfde geestdrift als de eerste dag0.023810, en men moest een vlaming zijn als koenraad om zich dien toestand te schikken een toestand die goed voor walvisschen andere zeebewoners ik geloof waarlijk dat als die goede jongen kieuwen plaats van longen gehad hij een uitstekende visch zou geweest zijn
0.035714, hij ver van de wijs maar voordat ik kon antwoorden wees hij mij op een handschrift dat voor hem op de tafel lag en zei op ernstigen toon
0.166667, ik hield op kapitein nemo opgestaan
0.017857, "laat ned land al denken en beproeven wat hij wil het kan mij niets schelen ik heb hem niet opgezocht het niet voor mijn genoegen dat ik hem aan boord houd wat u betreft mijnheer aronnax gij zijt een van die menschen die alles kunnen begrijpen zelfs het stilzwijgen ik heb u niets meer te antwoorden0.038463,  laat deze eerste maal dat gij mij die zaak komt spreken ook de laatste zijn want een tweede maal zou ik u zelfs niet kunnen aanhooren"
0.500000, hoofdstuk xliv
0.062500, "als mijnheer het niet kwalijk neemt hebben zij den eenhoorn herkend en zij schieten op hem"
0.034483, "mijnheer wij moeten alles beproeven om uit dien ellendigen toestand te geraken laten wij seinen geven duizend duivels men zal misschien dan toch begrijpen dat wij eerlijke lieden zijn"
0.250000, "dat zult gij niet"
0.017241, tegen vier uur des namiddags kon ik het ongeduld en de onrust die mij kwelden niet meer bedwingen en ik ging naar de middeltrap het luik stond open ik waagde mij op het plat de kapitein liep er ontroering heen en weer hij keek naar het schip dat op vijf zes kilometer onder den wind van ons afbleef 0.019231, hij draaide er als een wild dier omheen en het oostwaarts achter zich aanlokkend liet hij zich vervolgen evenwel viel hij niet aan misschien aarzelde hij nog ik wilde een laatste poging aanwenden maar nauwelijks ik den mond opengedaan hij legde mij het zwijgen op door te zeggen "ik ben de rechtvaar0.028571, digheid ik ben het recht ik ben de verdrukte daar de onderdrukker daardoor al wat ik heb liefgehad bemind en vernietigd vaderland vrouw kinderen vader en moeder al wat ik haat daar mij zwijg dus"
0.018519, ik reken (maar misschien bedrieg ik mij) dat deze zwerftocht van den nautilus vijftien twintig dagen aanhield en ik weet niet hoe lang hij nog zou geduurd hebben zonder het ongeluk dat er een einde aan maakte er van kapitein nemo geen sprake meer evenmin van zijn stuurman wij zagen niemand van de b0.023256, emanning de nautilus voer bijna aanhoudend onder water als wij boven kwamen om de lucht te ververschen opende en sloot het luik zich als 't ware van zelf op de kaart werd geen enkele aanteekening meer gemaakt ik wist niet waar wij waren
0.018519, ik moet ook zeggen dat de amerikaan die zijn krachten en geduld scheen verloren te hebben niet meer te voorschijn kwam koenraad kon geen enkel woord uit hem krijgen en vreesde dat hij een aanval van woede onder den indruk van een vreeselijk heimwee de hand aan zich zelven zou slaan hij bewaakte hem0.166668,  dus voortdurend met de grootste bezorgdheid
