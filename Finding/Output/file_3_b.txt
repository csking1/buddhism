0.022222, hoewel dit op zich zelve een zeer ernstig feit zou het wellicht als zoovele andere zaken vergeten zijn indien er niet drie weken later iets dergelijks onder gelijksoortige omstandigheden plaats gehad doch deze gebeurtenis kreeg bijzonder groote ruchtbaarheid door de herkomst van het schip waarmede 0.076923, het plaats vond door den grooten naam van de maatschappij waartoe het behoorde

0.020833, mijn stuk werd druk besproken en kreeg daardoor heel wat ruchtbaarheid ik een zeker aantal menschen op mijne hand de oplossing welke ik gaf leverde overigens stof genoeg op om aan de verbeelding vrij spel te laten de menschelijke geest schept behagen die grootsche gedachte aan bovennatuurlijke weze0.022222, ns en de zee juist het beste verblijf voor zulke schepsels zij het waar die reuzen waarbij landdieren als olifanten neushoorns slechts dwergen zijn zich vrij kunnen ontwikkelen het water bevat de grootste bekende zoogdieren en misschien verbergt het nog schelpdieren van onvergelijkelijken omvang sc0.025000, haaldieren afschuwelijk om te aanschouwen zooals bijvoorbeeld kreeften van honderd meter lengte krabben van twee honderd centenaar waarom niet voorhistorische tijden waren de landdieren viervoetige vierhandige kruipende dieren vogels enz van reusachtige grootte de schepper des heelals ze een koloss0.021277, alen vorm gegoten welke door den tijd kleiner geworden waarom zou de zee hare onbekende diepten geen staaltjes bewaard hebben van die reusachtige wezens uit de geologische tijdperken der aarde de zee toch verandert nooit terwijl de aardkorst elk oogenblik verandering ondergaat waarom zou zij de laa0.045455, tste verscheidenheden niet bevatten van die reuzen der voorwereld voor welke jaren gelijk zijn aan eeuwen en eeuwen gelijk aan duizend jaren

0.020833, "welke de electriciteit mij kon geven" viel kapitein nemo mij haastig de rede "ik herhaal het u mijnheer dat de dynamische kracht van mijne werktuigen bijna onbegrensd de pompen van de nautilus hebben eene verbazende kracht gij hebt dat dunkt mij reeds moeten ondervinden toen hare waterstralen zich0.018868,  als een woedende stroom op het dek van de abraham lincoln neerstortten overigens bedien ik mij van mijne hulpvergaarbakken slechts om eene gemiddelde diepte van 1500 tot 2000 meter te bereiken en dat wel om mijne toestellen te sparen als ik lust heb om den oceaan op eene diepte van twee drie kilom0.076934, eter te bezoeken dan heb ik veel langere doch even onfeilbare bewegingen noodig"

0.062500, daar berekende de kapitein de lengte en zeide toen "mijnheer aronnax wij zijn op 15' westerlengte"
0.019608, waarschijnlijk kon de kapitein deze gedachten duidelijk op mijn gelaat lezen doch hij vergenoegde zich met mij te verzoeken hem te volgen en ik deed dit als iemand die op alles voorbereid wij kwamen de eetzaal waar het ontbijt gereed stond "mijnheer aronnax" zeide de kapitein "ik verzoek u met mij 0.024390, te willen ontbijten dan kunnen wij op ons gemak praten ik heb u wel eene wandeling door de bosschen beloofd maar volstrekt niet gezegd dat gij daar eenige restauratie zoudt vinden ontbijt dus als iemand die eerst zeer laat dineeren zal"

0.020833, op bevel des kapiteins kwamen twee matrozen ons helpen om die zware ondoordringbare kleederen aan trekken zij waren van caoutchouc zonder naad en zoo gemaakt dat zij eene aanzienlijke drukking konden lijden het als het ware eene buigzame en sterke wapenrusting de kleederen vormden broek en buis aan0.024390,  elkander de broek eindigde zware schoenen met dikke looden zolen het buis van binnen gevoerd met koperen banden opdat de borst en dus de ademhaling vrij zou blijven de mouwen eindigden buigzame handschoenen welke de beweging der hand geenen deele hinderden

0.019231, de kapitein wachtte van mij zeker geen antwoord en het scheen mij dan ook onnoodig toe om hem mijn "juist" "zeker" "waarlijk" en andere woorden naar het hoofd te werpen hij sprak bijna tot zich zelven terwijl hij tusschen elke twee zinnen telkens vrij lang wachtte het eene overpeinzing met luider s0.040000, de kapitein eindigde zijn volzin met een driftig gebaar daarna richtte hij zich rechtstreeks tot mij als om sombere denkbeelden te verjagen en vroeg mij
0.076923, "zoudt gij mij die kunnen opnoemen opdat ik ze des noods kan nagaan"
0.020000, men ziet het dat de zee ons gedurende onze reis de schoonste wonderen vertoonde zij wisselde die het oneindige af zij veranderde elk oogenblik haar schouwspel tot ons genoegen en wij waren daardoor niet alleen getuigen van gods werken te midden van het vloeibaar element maar konden ook de vreeselij0.166667, kste geheimen van den oceaan doordringen
0.022222, het toeval misschien de nautilus op hare vaart juist bij het eiland clermonttonnerre gebracht een van de zonderlingste van deze groep welke 1822 door kapitein bell ontdekt werd ik kon nu de koralen bestudeeren aan welke de eilanden dien oceaan hun ontstaan te danken hebben

0.020408, den volgden dag hadden wij reeds 11340 kilometer afgelegd sedert ons vertrek uit de japansche zee voor de nautilus strekte zich de gevaarlijke koralenzee uit aan de noordoostkust van ons vaartuig liep op eenige kilometers afstands langs die gevaarlijke bank waarop de schepen van cook 10 juni 1770 b0.022222, ijna vergaan waren het schip waarop deze zeevaarder zich bevond stootte op een rif en zoo het niet zonk dit alleen te danken aan de toevallige omstandigheid dat het stuk koraal dat door den schok van de klip afgestooten de daardoor ontstane opening bleef vastzitten
0.020408, ziehier hoe onze toestand op twee kilometer afstand lag aan stuurboordzijde het eiland gueboroar welks kust zich als een lange arm van het noorden naar het westen kromde naar het zuiden en oosten vertoonden zich reeds eenige toppen van koraalriffen welke het afloopend getij bloot liet wij zaten geh0.018519, eel vast en dat wel eene zee waar het getij slechts middelmatig dit eene noodlottige omstandigheid om de nautilus weer vlot te krijgen echter het schip niets geleden zoo stevig de huid gesmeed maar als het al niet zinken barsten kon dan liep het toch gevaar voor eeuwig op die rotsen te blijven zitt0.083334, en en dan het gedaan met het onderzeesche toestel van kapitein nemo
0.500000, "ja zeker"
0.050000, "het zelfs geen brood meer" voegde de amerikaan er bij "het een heerlijk gebak hebt gij dat nooit gegeten mijnheer"
0.071429, "ik wel mijnheer wij hebben nog behoefte aan eenige vruchten althans groenten er bij"
0.166667, "wat nu reeds" riep ned land
0.076923, "is het ook familie van de patrijzen" viel ned land hem de rede
0.142857, "wat" riep koenraad "maakt men valsche paradijsvogels"
0.500000, "ja koen"
0.055556, wij sprongen alle drie overeind met het geweer de hand en waren gereed om elken aanval af te
0.020834, "naar de sloep" riep ik naar den zeekant loopende wij moesten inderdaad vluchten want een twintigtal inboorlingen met bogen en slingers gewapend verschenen aan den rand van een boschje dat op nauwelijks honderd pas afstands ons aan den rechterkant het uitzicht belette onze sloep lag tien vademen va0.055556, n ons af de wilden naderden langzaam maar maakten de meest vijandige bewegingen het regende pijlen en steenen
0.021278, ik ging weer op het plat de nacht reeds gevallen want onder deze breedte gaat de zon spoedig zonder schemering onder ik zag het eiland gueboroar slechts even maar talrijke vuren op het strand bewezen mij dat de inboorlingen er niet aan dachten om ons te verlaten
0.058824, op dit oogenblik naderden de prauwen dichter bij de nautilus en het regende pijlen om ons heen
0.050000, "binnen" riep men ik trad binnen en vond den kapitein verdiept eene berekening waarin allerlei stelkundige formulen de hoofdrol speelden
0.100000, "welnu dan het immers genoeg als het luik gesloten wordt"
0.019608, "wat uw d'urville aan de oppervlakte de zee verricht heeft" zeide kapitein nemo "dat doe ik onder zee en veel gemakkelijker en vollediger dan hij de astrolabe en de werden onophoudelijk door de golven heen en weder geslingerd en konden dus niet tegen de nautilus opwegen welke het midden der wateren0.111111,  stil ligt en dus een kalme studeerkamer heeten mag"
0.025641, "mijn jongen" zeide ik "toen ik de meening uitte dat zijn nautilus door de wilden bedreigd werd heeft de kapitein mij op schertsenden toon geantwoord ik kan u dus slechts ding antwoorden vertrouw op hem en ga gerust slapen"
0.100000, "wel door het luik als gij het laat open zetten"
0.021739, ik ging naar de groote middeltrap daar stonden ned land en koenraad zeer nieuwsgierig naar eenige matrozen te kijken die het luik openden terwijl kreten van woede en afgrijselijk geschreeuw daar buiten weerklonken eindelijk het luik open en een twintigtal afschuwelijke tronies verschenen maar de ee0.023810, rste van die wilden die de hand aan de trapleuning sloeg werd door ik weet niet welke onzichtbare kracht achteruitgeworpen en vluchtte onder vreeselijk geschreeuw en met ontzaglijke sprongen tien van zijne makkers wilden ook naar binnen komen en ondergingen hetzelfde lot
0.022222, gedurende verscheiden dagen brachten wij den tijd door met het nemen van allerlei proeven omtrent het zoutgehalte op verschillende diepte omtrent het geleidend vermogen de kleur en de doorschijnendheid van het zeewater en bij dit alles ontwikkelde de kapitein eene bekwaamheid welke slechts werd doo0.050000, r zijne welwillendheid jegens mij daarop zag ik hem gedurende eenige dagen weder niet en bleef ik als verlaten zitten
0.020408, wij waren toen getuigen van een zonderling schouwspel de wanden het salon waren weggeschoven en daar de electrieke lantaarn van de nautilus geen licht gaf heerschte er eene onbepaalde duisternis het water de met dikke wolken bedekte hemel deed slechts weinig licht de zee doordringen ik zat naar dit0.020834,  sombere schouwspel te kijken en de grootste visschen schenen mij niet meer dan zeer onduidelijke schaduwen toen de nautilus plotseling het volle licht kwam eerst dacht ik dat de lantaarn aangestoken en het electrieke licht het water scheen ik bedroog mij en herkende spoedig mijne dwaling de nautil0.022223, us dreef 't midden eener lichtgevende streep laag het water welke deze duisternis schitterend werd deze werd veroorzaakt door duizenden lichtgevende diertjes wier schittering nog toenam als zij langs de metalen wanden van ons vaartuig streken dan zag ik zelfs flikkeringen deze lichtende omgeving al0.021277, sof een stroom kokend lood een vuurhaard geworpen een stuk metaal tot roode gloeihitte gebracht werd dit zelfs zoo sterk dat eenige deelen van dezen schitterenden stroom nog schaduw wierpen hoewel alle schaduw daaruit verbannen scheen neen dit de kalme flikkering niet van ons gewone lichttoestel hi0.071429, er zag men kracht en eene ongewone beweging men gevoelde dat dit licht leefde
0.047619, "mijnheer aronnax" zeide hij op gebiedenden toon "ik eisch van u de vervulling van eene voorwaarde welke u aan mij bindt"
0.500000, "goed mijnheer"
0.083336, "gij kunt gerust spreken" zeide de kapitein "die man verstaat geen fransch"
0.037037, weldra echter stonden de struiken dichter op elkander en de takken werden grooter wij hadden wezenlijke versteende boschjes en lange galerijen van eene phantastische architectuur voor ons
0.038462, en terwijl hij plotseling het gelaat de krampachtig samengetrokken handen verborg trachtte de kapitein te vergeefs om zijn snikken te onderdrukken toen voegde hij er bij
0.020408, thans begint het tweede gedeelte mijner onderzeesche reis het eerste eindigt met het aangrijpend tooneel op het kerkhof dat zulk een diepen indruk op mijn geest maakte zoo ging dus het leven van kapitein nemo die onmetelijke zee voorbij en zelfs hij zich een graf bereid den ontoegankelijken afgrond0.021277,  daar zou zelfs geen enkel zeemonster den laatsten slaap storen van de mannen van den nautilus van de vrienden die zoowel het leven als den dood innig aan elkander verbonden waren "zelfs buiten het bereik der menschen" de kapitein er bijgevoegd altijd dat vreeselijk onverzoenlijk wantrouwen jegens 0.333333, de menschelijke maatschappij
0.083333, "juist" zei ik "en heeft hij u geen enkele bijzonderheid medegedeeld over"
0.333333, "honderd vijftig haaien"
0.021277, "o ja gulden anderhalf millioen gulden" hernam ik "maar ik geloof niet dat die visscherijen thans zooveel meer opbrengen als vroeger het hetzelfde geval met de amerikaansche visscherijen die onder de regeering van karel den vijfde twee millioen gulden opbrachten en thans slechts twee derde van die 0.041667, som opleveren om kort te gaan men kan de opbrengst van alle parelvisscherijen bij elkander op omstreeks vier en een half millioen gulden schatten"
0.250000, "wat juist het water"
0.333333, "volg mij dan"
0.022727, weldra waren wij tot den hals toe ons kleed van caoutchouc opgesloten en draagbanden bevestigden onze luchttoestellen op den rug van de toestellen van ruhmkorff geen sprake dat ik mijn hoofd den koperen helm stak vroeg ik naar de reden van dit laatste gemis
0.142857, "en onze wapens" vroeg ik "onze geweren"
0.020833, ik keek naar mijn makkers zij waren evenals wij gewapend maar bovendien drilde ned land een vreeselijkers harpoen dien hij ons vertrek de boot gelegd toen liet ik mij evenals den kapitein den helm opschroeven en bracht onmiddellijk het luchttoestel werking een oogenblik daarna lieten de matrozen on0.023810, s voor zee zakken en op anderhalven meter diepte stonden wij toen op een met fijn zand bedekten bodem de kapitein wenkte ons met de hand wij volgden hem en langs een zacht glooiende helling voortstappend verdwenen wij weldra onder de golven
0.020000, den loop van 29 januari verdween het eiland ceylon aan den gezichteinder en de nautilus gleed met een vaart van twintig kilometer door dien doolhof van kanalen die de maladiven van de laccadiven scheiden hij liep onmiddellijk langs het eiland kittan dat door koralen gevormd door vasco de gama 1499 0.045455, ontdekt werd en een van de negentien voornaamste eilanden van den laccadivenarchipel welke tusschen en 30' nb en en 72' ol ligt
0.018182, den volgenden dag 30 januari kwam de nautilus weer boven doch wij hadden geen land het gezicht de richting nnw en wij naderden de zee van osman tusschen en waarin de perzische golf hare monding heeft wij voeren een zee zonder ingang waar bracht ons kapitein nemo toch heen ik zou het niet hebben kun0.066667, nen zeggen ned land daarover zeer ontevreden toen hij er mij dien dag naar vroeg
0.034483, "die luimen kunnen ons niet ver brengen" antwoordde de amerikaan "de perzische golf heeft geen uitgang en als wij er binnenvaren zullen wij spoedig langs dienzelfden weg moeten terugkeeren"
0.166667, "en wat zal het einde zijn"
0.019231, door dit korte gesprek zal men gewaar worden dat ik dweepte met den nautilus en als het ware met den kapitein vereenzelvigd wat ned land aanging hij eindigde het gesprek met als tot zich zelven te zeggen "dat alles goed en wel maar volgens mijn meening bestaat er geen genoegen met dwang"
0.062500, "het dus de eerste maal niet kapitein dat gij met den nautilus de roode zee komt"
0.066667, "ja eere aan dien grooten burger" antwoordde ik verwonderd den toon waarop kapitein nemo gesproken
0.125000, "maar de landengte bestaat enkel uit beweegbaar zand"
0.066667, ik lette schijnbaar niet op dit gezegde en wachtte op het verhaal van den kapitein
0.058824, op den rand der sloep geleund spraken wij koetjes en kalfjes toen ned zijn hand uitstrekkende zei
0.055557, "waarlijk" zei ik na nauwkeurig te hebben toegezien "ik zie een lang zwartachtig lichaam op het water drijven"
0.025641, "ja ned zijn vleesch wordt zeer gezocht en men bewaart het den maleischen archipel voor vorstelijke tafels men jaagt dan ook zoo fel op dit uitmuntend dier dat het evenals zijns gelijke de zeekoe hoe langer zoo zeldzamer wordt
0.071429, "misschien" hervatte de amerikaan "doch het belang van den kok om het te vangen"
0.125000, "doe het dan meester land" antwoordde de kapitein
0.142857, "mijn harpoen mijn harpoen" riep ned land
0.062500, "een drijvende vuurbaak" zei een stem naast mij ik keerde mij om en herkende den kapitein
0.071429, "kom maar mee dan zult gij al het mogelijke van deze onderzeesche vaart zien"
0.030303, "wat ik u te vertellen heb dood eenvoudig" antwoordde de amerikaan "wij zijn europa en voordat de luimen van kapitein nemo ons naar de den grooten oceaan terugvoeren wil ik den nautilus poetsen"
0.142857, "er zal een eind aan komen ned"
0.045455, "en als hij er bijvoegde dat het aanbod dat u heden gedaan werd nimmer weer herhaald zou worden zoudt gij dat aannemen"
0.024391, "slechts opmerking" zei ik "een enkele de gelegenheid moet goed zijn onze eerste poging om te vluchten moet gelukken want doet zij het niet dan zullen wij de gelegenheid waarschijnlijk nooit weer krijgen en kapitein nemo zal het ons niet vergeven"
0.071429, "deze dat de nautilus wel een somberen nacht kort bij eenige europeesche kust komt"
0.031250, "ja als wij dicht genoeg bij de kust waren en de nautilus aan de oppervlakte dreef doch zeker niet als wij te ver van land waren en het vaartuig onder water voer"
0.142857, "en wat zou je dit geval doen"
0.250000, "ik zei niets kapitein"
0.500000, "tweeenveertig graden"
0.052632, "dat merk ik kapitein" antwoordde ik "en als die warmte nog toeneemt zullen wij die niet meer kunnen verdragen"
0.058824, "mijnheer moet mij niet kwalijk nemen" zei hij "maar dat een wezenlijke landtong tusschen europa en afrika"
0.249999, de golf van vigo
0.030303, "vriend ned" zei ik "ik begrijp je maar je hebt je niets te verwijten de gedachte aan de vlucht zou een groote dwaasheid geweest zijn nu de nautilus zoo vreeselijk snel voorwaarts ging"
0.052632, ned land antwoordde niet zijne gesloten lippen en gefronste wenkbrauwen duidden genoegzaam aan dat maar gedachte hem bezig hield
0.018868, mijn middagmaal werd mij als naar gewoonte mijn kamer gebracht ik slecht daar ik veel te afgetrokken ik ging te zeven uur van tafel honderd twintig minutenik telde zescheidden mij nog van het oogenblik dat ik met ned land zou meegaan mijn angst verdubbelde mijn pols sloeg hevig ik kon niet op mijn 0.019231, plaats blijven zitten ik liep heen en weer omdat ik daardoor de onrust van mijn gemoed hoopte te doen bedaren het denkbeeld onze gewaagde onderneming niet te slagen de minste mijner zorgen maar de gedachte ons plan ontdekt te zien wij den nautilus verlaten hadden en gebracht te worden voor den toor0.062500, nigen wat nog erger den door onze vlucht treurigen kapitein dat deed mijn hart hevig kloppen
0.022222, op dit oogenblik troffen mij eenige teekeningen die langs de wanden hingen en waarop ik vroeger niet gelet het waren portretten van groote historische mannen wier leven slechts de voortdurende opoffering aan een groote menschelijke gedachte geweest kosciusko de held die met den poolschen volkszang 0.023810, op de lippen gevallen botzaris de leonidas van het nieuwe griekenland o'connell de verdediger van ierlands onafhankelijkheid washington de grondlegger der amerikaansche unie manin de italiaansche patriot lincoln door den dolk van een voorstander der slavernij gevallen en eindelijk de martelaar der 0.041667, bevrijding van het ras der zwarten john brown aan de galg hangend zooals de pen van victor hugo ons dit zoo vreeselijk geschilderd heeft
0.022222, welke band bestond er tusschen die heldenzielen en de ziel van kapitein nemo kon ik uit die portrettenverzameling het geheim van zijn leven raden hij de kampvechter voor de onderdrukte volken en de bevrijder der onder slavernij zuchtende hij de laatste staatkundige maatschappelijke beroeringen van 0.045455, deze eeuw een rol gespeeld hij een der helden geweest van den vreeselijken amerikaanschen oorlog die zoo ellendig en zoo roemrijk tevens
0.018868, maar kapitein nemo klom steeds door ik wilde niet achterblijven en volgde met moed mijn stok mij daarbij van veel nut een misstap zou gevaarlijk geweest zijn op die smalle voetpaden die aan den rand van afgronden schenen uitgehouwen te zijn maar ik liep met vasten tred door en werd niet duizelig nu0.019608,  eens sprong ik een spleet welker diepte mij de bergen op aarde zou hebben doen terugdeinzen dan eens waagde ik mij den gladden stam van boomen de randen eens afgronds geworpen zonder naar beneden te zien daar ik geen oogen genoeg om de schoonheid dezer wildernissen te bewonderen op andere plaatsen0.023256,  schenen rotsblokken als gedenkteekenen op hun onregelmatig gehouwen voetstukken den spot te drijven met de wetten van evenwicht tusschen hun steenen uitstekken schoten boomen te voorschijn als waterstralen onder een vreeselijke drukking en steunden elkander onderling dan zag ik wederom door de nat0.021277, uur gevormde torens en groote muurbrokken als van kasteelen voorzien met zulk een helling voorover hangen als de wetten der zwaartekracht op de oppervlakte der aarde niet zouden gedoogd hebben en ik bemerkte zelfs het verschil niet tusschen de dichtheid van water en van lucht want niettegenstaande 0.041667, mijn zware kleederen mijn koperen helm en mijn looden zolen beklom ik hellingen van onbegrijpelijke steilte met de vlugheid van een geit een gems
0.023810, inderdaad daar lag onder mijn oogen een verwoeste stad met ingestorte daken vernielde tempels uit elkander gescheurde zuilen en neergeworpen kolommen welke men vermoeden kon dat tot de stevige toskaansche bouworde behoord hadden verder op lagen de overblijfselen eener reusachtige waterleiding hier 0.020833, lag het hooge muurwerk van een burcht met gebouwen waarin men de vormen van het parthenon giste daar overblijfselen van een kade alsof een vervlogen eeuwen aan de kust van een verdwenen oceaan aan koopvaardij en oorlogsschepen tot ankerplaats gestrekt nog verder lange lijnen van elkander gestorte m0.050001, uren breede en verlaten straten een geheel pompeji daar het water verzonken en door kapitein nemo onder mijn oog gebracht
0.500000, hoofdstuk xxxiv
0.166666, "maar welke die vulkaan" vroeg ik
0.027027, "ik zie kapitein dat de natuur u overal en altijd dient gij zijt op dit meer veiligheid en niemand als gij kunt het bezoeken maar waarvoor hebt gij die schuilplaats noodig de nautilus behoeft toch geen haven"
0.125000, "en zal ik ze aan 't werk zien"
0.022727, "kunt gij u voorstellen" vroeg ik hun "hoe deze trechter er uit moest zien toen hij gevuld met kokende lava en die gloeiende vloeibare massa zich tot aan de opening van den berg verhief evenals het kokend metaal binnen de wanden van een hoogoven"
0.090909, "ja zeker" riep de amerikaan "de bijen gonzen er om heen"
0.166666, "wat er" vroeg ik half opstaande
0.500000, hoofdstuk xxxv
0.020833, de krooszee bedekt om zoo te zeggen het land dat door den oceaan verzwolgen sommige schrijvers hebben zelfs beweerd dat het zeegras hetwelk deze zee groote menigte ronddrijft van de weiden van dit vroegere vasteland afkomstig waarschijnlijk echter dit zeegras en wier afkomstig van de kusten van eur0.018519, opa en amerika en wordt door den golfstroom tot op deze hoogte medegesleept dit een van de redenen die columbus deden gelooven aan het bestaan van een nieuwe wereld toen de schepen van dezen koenen zeevaarder de krooszee kwamen hadden zij werk om door dit gras heen te komen omdat het tot groote ont0.055556, steltenis van de equipage hunne vaart tegenhield zij besteedden zelfs drie weken er om er doorheen te worstelen
0.018868, zoo de streek door den nautilus op dit oogenblik bezocht het een wezenlijke weide zulk een dicht tapijt van gras zeekroos en wier dat een schip er niet zonder moeite kon doorvaren kapitein nemo wilde zich met zijn schroefboot dan ook niet deze massa gras wagen en bleef op eenige meters diepte onder0.500000,  de golven
0.019608, "zoo weet men dat" antwoordde de kapitein een weinig verwonderd "welnu mijnheer de professor dan weet men het goed want het de waarheid ik voeg er nog bij dat de zwemblaas der visschen meer stikstof dan zuurstof bevat wanneer zij aan de oppervlakte van het water gevangen worden doch daarentegen mee0.043478, r zuurstof dan stikstof als men ze uit grootere diepte ophaalt wat een bewijs voor uw stelling maar laten wij ons onderzoek voortzetten"
0.090909, "wij wilden u een eenvoudige vraag doen mijnheer" antwoordde de amerikaan
0.333333, "spreek op ned"
0.083336, "hoeveel man denkt gij dat er aan boord van den nautilus zijn"
0.058824, "het komt mij voor" hernam ned land "dat er voor dit vaartuig geen talrijke equipage noodig is"
0.090909, "hoe ned" zei ik "hebje de vroegere vischliefhebberij nog niet afgezworen"
0.111111, "wat zegt gij daar mijnheer" vroeg de amerikaan ongeloovig
0.166667, "gij moet mijnheer gelooven" antwoordde koenraad
0.043478, "dan besluit ik hieruit" hernam de harpoenier "dat ik de walvisschen van deze zee niet ken omdat ik hier nog niet geweest ben"
0.032258, "want ik heb groote walvisschen gezien mijnheer beesten van ruim dertig meter lang zelfs heb ik wel hooren zeggen dat de walvisschen bij de aleutische eilanden soms vijftig meter lang waren"
0.166667, "en hoe weet jij dat ned"
0.066667, "het zijn zuidelijke walvisschen" zei hij "de geheele fortuin van een vloot walvischvaarders zwemt ons"
0.021739, de zee met verminkte krengen bedekt een geweldige uitbarsting zou de vleeschklompen niet beter gedood vaneengescheurd en vernield hebben wij dreven te midden van reusachtige lichamen die blauwachtig op den rug wit aan den buik en met groote builen uitwassen bedekt waren eenige potvisschen zagen wij0.041667,  zoover het oog reikte angstig vluchten de golven waren verscheiden kilometer den omtrek rood geverfd de nautilus dreef te midden eener zee van bloed
0.026316, van dien dag af merkte ik niet zonder ongerustheid dat de verhouding van ned land tegenover den kapitein hoe langer hoe slechter werd en ik nam mij voor de handelingen van den amerikaan van nabij gade te slaan
0.020408, den 14den maart zag ik op breedte drijvende ijsschotsen het waren brokken van zes acht meter lengte die daar ronddreven als klippen waartegen de golven braken de nautilus bleef boven drijven ned land die vroeger reeds de noordelijke ijszee gevischt kende die ijsbergen maar koen en ik bewonderden ze0.022222,  voor de eerste maal aan den zuidelijken gezichteinder strekte zich een schitterend witte streep uit engelsche walvischvaarders hebben er den naam van "ijsschittering" aan gegeven hoe dik de wolken ook zijn mogen zij kunnen deze heldere streep niet verduisteren zij kondigt een ijsbank aan inderdaad0.023256,  weldra verschenen grootere stukken welker helderheid afwisselde naar gelang van de nevels waarin wij gehuld waren sommige van die gevaarten hadden groenachtige aderen alsof zwavelzuur koper er zulke golvende lijnen op getrokken andere zagen er uit als verbazend groote amathysten waar de lichtstral0.021277, en doorheen vielen wederom andere kaatsten het daglicht tegen de duizende kristalvlakjes terug nog andere waren hagelwit als kalksteen en zouden als ze van marmer waren geweest bouwstof genoeg voor een geheele stad hebben opgeleverd hoe verder wij naar het zuiden gingen hoe meer de drijvende eiland0.026316, en grootte en getal toenamen duizenden vogels hadden er hun nesten op gebouwd zij verdoofden ons door hun geschreeuw sommige zagen den nautilus voor een dooden walvisch aan streken er op neer en pikten op de ijzeren platen
0.125000, "maar waar gaat hij toch heen" vroeg ik
0.026316, "o mijnheer de professor" antwoordde kapitein nemo op spottenden toon "gij verandert nooit gij ziet slechts hinderpalen en moeilijkheden ik verzeker u daarentegen dat de nautilus niet alleen los zal komen maar ook nog vrij wat verder gaan"
0.021739, "ik zie dat wij elkander beginnen te begrijpen mijnheer de professor" zei de kapitein glimlachend "gij doorziet reeds de mogelijkheid ik zou zeggen het welslagen dezer onderneming wat voor een gewoon vaartuig onmogelijk wordt voor den nautilus gemakkelijk indien er aan de pool eenig vasteland zulle0.062500, n wij daarvoor blijven steken er daarentegen open zee dan gaan wij naar de pool zelf"
0.032258, doch hoe onverschillig hij ook geweest mocht zijn hij het toch niet zoozeer als koenraad toen ik den braven jongen ons voornemen meedeelde om tot aan de zuidpool door te dringen
0.030303, ik met koenraad den salon plaats genomen door het open raam beschouwden wij de diepten van de zuidelijke ijszee de thermometer rees weer en de naald van den manometer begon af te wijken
0.250000, "open zee" zei hij
0.033333, "als men nog een weinig verder ging zouden het volmaakte lampen zijn" antwoordde koenraad "doch men kan toch niet vergen dat de natuur ze ook nog met een pit voorziet"
0.090909, "twee soorten uit de orde de vleeschetende zoogdieren" antwoordde koen haastig
0.021739, "gij hebt gelijk mijnheer aronnax" zei hij "als ik morgen de zonshoogte niet kan waarnemen moet ik dit zes maanden uitstellen maar als de zon zich morgen vertoont zal het juist omdat het dan 21 maart gemakkelijk wezen om te twaalf uur onze waarneming te doen"
0.250000, "hoe zoo" vroeg ik
0.045455, "juist" zei ik "maar toch deze waarneming niet wiskundig zeker omdat de dag en nachtevening niet precies om twaalf uur plaats heeft"
0.018868, toen zocht ik ned land op en wilde hem overhalen met ons mee te gaan maar de koppige amerikaan weigerde en ik zag wel dat zijn stilzwijgen en zijn halsstarrigheid met den dag toenamen evenwel betreurde ik deze omstandigheden zijn koppigheid niet want er waren te veel zeekalven aan land en men moest0.125000,  zulk een harpoenier niet aan onweerstaanbare verzoeking blootstellen
0.028571, terwijl hij dit zei ontrolde kapitein nemo een zwarte vlag waar midden een witte n geborduurd daarop keerde hij zich naar de zon wier laatste stralen nog aan den gezichteinder verschenen en riep hij uit
0.040000, "vaarwel zon verdwijn schitterende dagvorst verberg u achter deze vrije zee en laat een nacht van zes maanden met zijn schaduwen neerdalen mijn nieuw gebied"
0.142857, "dat kom ik mijnheer vragen" antwoordde koenraad
0.027027, de nautilus helde altijd nog naar stuurboordzijde hij zou eerst recht gaan liggen als de ijsbank stuitte doch wie weet wij dan de onderzijde van de ijsbank niet zouden bereiken en tusschen de beide ijsmassaas verpletterd worden
0.021739, vijf minuten voor half negen stootte de nautilus ten tweeden male doch ditmaal van achteren ik verbleekte mijn makkers kwamen dichter bij mij ik greep koenraads hand wij ondervroegen elkander met de oogen en dat op welsprekender wijze dan wij het met woorden hadden kunnen doen
0.032258, dien avond moest de kapitein de kranen van zijn luchtvergaderbakken openen om zoodoende de atmosfeer den nautilus eenigszins te ververschen zonder die voorzorg zouden wij den volgenden morgen niet zijn opgestaan
0.020409, de thermometer wees buiten toen zeven graden ik ging met den kapitein naar de keuken waar groote distilleerketels stonden om ons drinkbaar water te bezorgen zij werden vol water gevuld en daarna werd al de electrische warmte der toestellen door de slangen gelaten binnen weinige minuten kookte het w0.018182, ater het werd naar de pompen geleid terwijl er telkens weer nieuw water de ketels kwam de warmte zoo groot dat als het koude zeewater alleen door de toestellen heen gegaan het kokend de pompen kwam de werking begon en drie uur daarna wees de thermometer zes graden onder nul aan wij hadden dus graad0.090910,  gewonnen twee uren later wees de thermometer maar vier graden aan
0.035714, niettegenstaande het gesuis mijn hoofd hoorde ik weldra een gekraak onder den nautilus wij zakten het ijs kraakte zonderling evenals papier dat gescheurd wordt en de nautilus daalde
0.021277, den volgenden dag 1 april toen de nautilus weer aan de oppervlakte kwam zagen wij eenige minuten voor twaalven de westkust het het vuurland waaraan de eerste zeereizigers dien naam gaven toen zij tallooze rookkolommen uit de hutten der inlanders zagen opstijgen het een aaneenschakeling van eilandje0.017857, s tot zb en 50' tot 15' wl de kust scheen lang te zijn maar de verte verhieven zich hooge bergen ik geloof zelfs dat ik den sarmiento zien kon die 2070 meter hoog deze berg een hooge piramide van leisteen wier top naarmate deze zichtbaar met wolken omhuld fraai leelijk weder aankondigt zooals ned l0.500000, and zei
0.019231, een der netten bevatte een soort van zeer platten rog die als men hem den staart afgesneden een volkomen schijf zou gevormd hebben en die ongeveer twintig kilogram woog deze visch van onder wit en van boven rood met groote ronde donkerblauwe vlekken en half dubbele vinnen op het vlak geworpen spron0.018182, g die visch zoo vreeselijk en maakte zooveel geweld dat hij met een laatsten sprong zee zou geweest zijn maar koenraad die den rog wilde behouden wierp zich er op en greep het dier voordat ik het beletten kon met twee handen vast plotseling werd hij met de beenen de lucht achterover geworpen en vie0.200000, l hij als verpletterd neer
0.055556, "mooi zoo" barstte ned land het uit van 't lachen "mijnheer koen houdt mij geducht voor den gek"
0.018519, "in 1861 zag de bemanning van de alecton ten n w van teneriffe op ongeveer dezelfde breedte waar wij ons nu bevinden een monsterachtigen inktvisch het zog van het schip zwemmen de kapitein bouguer naderde het dier en men viel het met harpoen en geweer aan doch zonder goed gevolg want kogels en harp0.019231, oenen gingen door het beest heen waarvan het vleesch zoo week als gelei na vele vluchtelooze pogingen gelukte het der bemanning een strik om den staart van het weekdier te werpen deze strik gleed vast tegen de staartvinnen en bleef daar zitten men beproefde toen om het monster aan boord te hijschen0.037037,  maar de zwaarte van het dier zoo groot dat de staart door het knellen van het touw er afscheurde en het beest zonder dit sieraad zee viel"
0.083333, "had hij geen verbazend groote oogen die boven op den kop stonden"
0.032258, ik keek op mijn beurt en kon een gevoel van afgrijzen niet onderdrukken voor mijn oogen spartelde een vreeselijk monster dat waard om de legenden der wonderwereld een plaats te nemen
0.125000, "en dit niettegenstaande hij het al gezegd heeft"
0.111111, "maar ik ontmoet hem zelden zelfs mijdt hij mij"
0.200000, "noem het zooals gij wilt"
0.037038, "nu weten wij" zei ned "dat er van dien man niets te hopen de nautilus nadert longisland wij zullen dus vluchten hoe het weer ook moge zijn"
0.018182, ik bekeek de vreeselijke zoo nauwkeurig als onze toestand dit toeliet zij waren tot zelfs vijftien meter hoog 150 tot 175 meter lang en rolden voort met een snelheid van vijftien meter de seconde de watermassa en de kracht ervan nam toe met de diepte van het water ik begreep toen welke rol de golve0.018868, n speelden daar zij lucht opnemen en die met geweld naar de diepte der zee dringen waar ze met de zuurstof dus het leven aanbrengen de kracht van die golven heeft men berekend zij kan zich zelfs verheffen tot 27000 kilogrammen op den vierkanten meter wanneer zij ergens tegen aanklotsen het waren zu0.022727, lke baren die op de hebriden een rotsblok van 48000 kilogrammen hebben omvergeworpen die den storm van 23 december 1864 een gedeelte van de stad yeddo omverwierpen en met een snelheid van 200 kilometer het uur dienzelfden dag nog de kust van amerika bereikten
0.027778, "wat zijt gij onnoozel" zei ik "de kabeljauw plat bij den kruidenier waar ze opengesneden platgeslagen en gedroogd als stokvisch voor de ramen ligt maar het water zijn zij rond en juist geschikt om te zwemmen"
0.021739, deze wijze van spreken het onverwachte van dit tooneel het kalm verhaal van het schip dat met zijn vaderlandslievende bemanning gezonken de ontroering waarmede de zonderlinge man de laatste woorden uitgesproken de naam van den vengeur welks beteekenis mij niet kon ontsnappen alles vereenigde zich o0.017544, m mij te treffen ik de oogen van den kapitein niet afgewend hij de handen voor zich uitgestrekt en beschouwde met een vurig oog het beroemde wrak misschien zou ik nimmer te weten komen wie hij waar hij vandaan kwam en waar hij heenging maar ik zag meer en meer den mensch zich uit den geleerde ontwi0.025641, kkelen het geen gewone menschenhaat die den kapitein en zijn makkers den nautilus hield opgesloten maar een monsterachtige verheven haat dien de tijd niet kon verzwakken zocht deze haat zich te wreken dit zou de toekomst mij weldra ophelderen
0.035714, de amerikaan trok de wenkbrauwen samen kneep de oogleden op elkander en de oogen half dicht en keek eenige oogenblikken zoo scherp als hij kon naar het schip
0.031251, "neen mijnheer" antwoordde hij "ik kan het niet zien het heeft geen vlag top maar ik kan u verzekeren dat het een oorlogschip want een lange wimpel waait van den grooten mast"
0.019608, gedurende een kwartier bekeken wij het vaartuig dat naar ons toekwam ik kon evenwel niet gelooven dat het op dien afstand den nautilus herkend noch veel minder dus dat het wist wat dit voor een onderzeesch werktuig weldra vertelde de amerikaan mij dat het een groote gepantserde met een spoor gewape0.020000, nde tweedekker een dikke rookwolk steeg uit de beide schoorsteenen op de gereefde zeilen zaten op de ra's vastgebonden het vertoonde geen vlag de afstand verhinderde ons de kieur van den wimpel te onderscheiden die als een dun lintje de lucht wapperde het naderde met groote snelheid als kapitein ne0.083333, mo het schip liet naderen bood zich een kans tot redding aan
0.250000, toen zei de amerikaan
0.200000, "wij zullen vluchten" zei ik
0.019231, wie zou kunnen zeggen waar ons de nautilus dien oceaan sedert dat oogenblik heensleepte altijd met een onberekenbare snelheid altijd te midden van een dikken noordschen mist waren wij bij spitsbergen bij nova zembla voeren wij door onbekende door de witte zee die van kara de golf van obi langs de b0.020000, ijna niet bekende kust van noordelijk ik kan het niet zeggen ik kon den tijd die er verliep niet berekenen de klokken aan boord stonden stil het scheen dat evenals de poolstreken nacht en dag elkander niet meer geregeld opvolgden ik voelde mij een vreemde wereld rondvoeren ieder oogenblik verwachtt0.038462, e ik een menschelijk wezen te zien verschijnen dat grooter dan eenig sterveling zich voor den waterval zou stellen die den toegang tot de noordpool verhindert
0.020833, op dit oogenblik kunnen wij er nog niet aan denken om naar frankrijk terug te keeren de middelen van gemeenschap tusschen het noorden van noorwegen en de zuidelijker streken zijn zeldzaam ik moet dus wachten totdat de boot voorbijkomt die tweemaal de maand geregeld naar de noordkaap vaart
