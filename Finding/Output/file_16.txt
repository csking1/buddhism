0.020834, de stuurman den kijker weder ter hand genomen en keek onophoudelijk naar den gezichteinder hij liep heen en weder stampte met den voet en tegenstelling met zijn meester zenuwachtige spanning het geheim zou echter weldra worden opgelost want op een wenk van kapitein nemo vermeerderde de machine hare0.020408,  snelheid op dat oogenblik maakte de stuurman den kapitein op nieuw opmerkzaam deze staakte zijne wandeling en richtte den kijker nog eens naar het aangewezen punt hij keek lang ik zeer nieuwsgierig en ging naar het salon van waar ik een uitmuntenden kijker medebracht dien ik gewoonlijk gebruikte i0.027778, k legde dien op de lantaarn en maakte mij gereed om den gezichteinder te doorloopen toen ik nog voor ik den kijker goed aan het oog gebracht hem mij met drift uit de hand voelde rukken

0.111111, ik keek den gewonde nog eens aan en antwoordde
0.020834, de hand van den kapitein wrong zich krampachtig samen en eenige tranen sprongen hem uit de oogen welke ik niet dacht dat ooit tranen konden storten ik beschouwde nogmaals den stervende wiens leven langzaam wegvlood zijne bleekheid werd nog vermeerderd door het electrieke licht hetwelk dit doodbed b0.024390, escheen ik vestigde het oog op het schrandere gelaat waarin tal van rimpels door het ongeluk misschien door de ellende gegrift waren ik trachtte door te dringen het geheim van dit leven door middel van enkele woorden welke zijn lippen kwamen
0.023256, het licht veroorzaakte schitterende kleurschakeeringen tusschen die heldere takjes het als zag ik die cylindervormige pijpjes door de golving van het water trillen ik lust om die frissche bloemknoppen te plukken waarvan sommige pas geopend waren en andere ternauwernood uitbotten terwijl kleine visc0.020408, hjes als ware het een zwerm vogeltjes met vlugge vin er tusschen doorschoten doch als ik met de hand naar die levende bloemen naar die bezielde takjes greep dan alles eensklaps opschudding de witte knoppen weken roode kokertjes terug de bloemen verdwenen en het heestertje veranderde een met kleine 0.022222, uitwassen begroeid stuk steen het toeval mij bij de kostbaarste gebracht deze koraalsoort minstens evenveel waard als die welke de middellandsche zee op de fransche italiaansche en afrikaansche kusten gevonden wordt de dichters geven haar met recht de namen van "bloedbloem" en "bloedschuim" welke d0.019231, en handel als de beste soort worden beschouwd die koralen kosten tot honderd rijksdaalders het kilogram en op deze plek lag de fortuin van een wereld van koralenvisschers onder de zee bedolven tusschen deze kostbare stof welke hier vast opeengepakt en bijna niet los te rukken vond ik van tijd tot t0.250000, ijd wonderschoone rozeroode koralen

0.043478, den volgenden morgen werd ik om vier uur door den hofmeester gewekt ik stond spoedig op kleedde mij en ging naar het salon
0.019608, de boot richtte zich naar het zuiden de roeiers haastten zich niet en ik merkte op dat de riemen die met kracht en diep door het water geslagen werden slechts om de tien seconden een slag deden zooals gewoonlijk bij de oorlogsmarine geschiedt terwijl de boot voortschoot vielen de waterdroppels als 0.023810, waren ze kokend lood van de telkens omhoog gehouden riemen op het donker watervlak een kleine bries die ons uit het zuiden tegemoet woei deed de boot een weinig slingeren en eenige golven spatten tegen den voorsteven van ons ranke vaartuig uiteen
0.018868, nadat wij een vrij steile helling waren afgegaan kwamen wij onder een ronden put daar hield nemo stil en wees ons met de hand een voorwerp dat ik nog niet opgemerkt het een oester van buitengewone grootte een reusachtige schelp een wijwaterbak die een zee van wijwater kon bevatten een schaal van me0.055556, er dan twee meter breed en derhalve veel grooter dan die welke den salon van den nautilus versierde
0.018519, toen begreep ik wat het plan van den kapitein door die parel de oester te laten gaf hij haar de gelegenheid om te groeien elk jaar werd ze grooter door de afscheiding van het dier dat er telkens nieuwe lagen omheen legde de kapitein kende de grot waar deze bewonderenswaardige "vrucht" der natuur ri0.019608, jpte hij kweekte die om zoo te zeggen aan om haar eens zijn kostbare verzameling op te nemen misschien hij op voorbeeld van chineezen en die parel doen voortbrengen door een stukje glas metaal de oester te leggen dat daar langzamerhand met parelmoerlagen overtogen allen gevalle als ik deze parel ve0.029413, rgeleek met de mij bekende dan moest ik hare waarde op minstens vijf millioen gulden stellen het een prachtige zeldzaamheid doch geen voorwerp van weelde want welke vrouwelijke ooren hadden haar ooit kunnen dragen
0.020834, de duiker zag ons niet de schaduw der rots verborg ons voor zijn oog en bovendien hoe zou de arme hindoe ooit gedroomd hebben dat menschen zooals hij daar onder het water zijn nabijheid stonden al zijn bewegingen bespiedden en geen enkele bijzonderheid van zijn visscherij onopgemerkt lieten
0.020834, verscheidene malen daalde en steeg hij hij bracht telkens niet meer dan een dozijn oesters naar boven want hij moest ze met geweld losscheuren van de rotsbedding waarop ze met hun sterk weefsel vastzaten en hoevele van die oesters waarvoor hij zijn leven waagde waren nog zonder parels
0.020000, de haai brulde om zoo te zeggen het bloed stroomde uit zijn wond het zeewater werd rood gekleurd zoodat ik door het ondoorschijnende der vloeistof bijna niets meer zag eindelijk bemerkte ik een helder oogenblik den stoutmoedigen kapitein weer die zich aan een der vinnen van het dier vastgeklampt de0.020000, n buik van het monster met dolksteken als doorploegde en hem toch den beslissenden stoot niet het hart kon geven de haai bracht het water door zijn woedende stuiptrekkingen hevige beweging zoodat ik verscheiden malen op het punt stond mijn evenwicht te verliezen ik den kapitein te hulp willen snell0.083333, en doch van afgrijzen als aan den grond genageld stond ik bewegingloos
0.250000, "wat veronderstelt gij dan"
0.041667, "deze zee wordt inderdaad als een van de onstuimigste opgegeven en indien ik mij niet bedrieg dan stond zij de oudheid den slechtsten reuk"

0.018519, men begrijpe de woede van ned land hij wierp het ongelukkige dier de krachtigste amerikaansche vloeken naar den kop wij vervolgden het een uur lang en ik begon te gelooven dat het moeielijk zou zijn het te vangen toen de dugong op het noodlottig denkbeeld kwam zich te wreken dit zou hem weldra bero0.058824, uwen hij snelde op de sloep aan om die aan te vallen dit ontging niet den amerikaan

0.333333, "waar en wanneer"
0.018869, "misschien hier misschien bij china je weet het dat de nautilus een groote snelheid bezit hij doorklieft het water als een vogel de lucht hij vreest geen druk bezochte wie zegt je dat hij de kusten van frankrijk engeland amerika niet zal naderen waar wij ten minste even goed een vlucht kunnen bepro0.333429, even als hier"
0.028571, "mijnheer aronnax" antwoordde de amerikaan uw redeneering rust op verkeerden grondslag u spreekt het toekomende "dan zullen wij hier daar zijn" maar ik spreek het tegenwoordige "wij zijn hier en wij moeten daarvan gebruik maken"
0.076923, ik moest noodwendig een beslissing nemen en uitvluchten stuitten mij tegen de borst
0.017544, ik zinspeelde dus het geheel niet op deze gebeurtenis toen ik dien avond met hem alleen den salon bovendien kwam het mij voor dat hij stil en afgetrokken toen gaf hij tegen zijn gewoonte bevel om de wanden open te schuiven en hij liep van het eene glas naar het andere om het water nauwkeurig te bes0.020833, chouwen waarom ik kon het niet raden en ik hield mij enkel bezig met de visschen te beschouwen die ons voorbij zwommen ik zag onder anderen drie centimeter lange cheilonen kleine visschen met doorschijnende schubben loodkleurig en met roode vlekjes zij eten veelal zeeplanten waardoor zij een uitste0.024390, kenden smaak hebben die vischjes waren bij de lekkerbekken te rome zeer gezocht hunne ingewanden met zeeslakkenmelk pauwenhersens en papegaaientongetjes klaar gemaakt vormden den goddelijken schotel die vitellius verrukking bracht een andere zeebewoner uit deze streken bracht mij de oudheid nogmaal0.018182, s herinnering het de remora die zich aan den buik der haaien vasthecht en medezwemt volgens het beweren der ouden kon deze kleine visch als hij zich aan de kiel van een schip hechtte het de vaart tegenhouden en toen een van deze dieren den slag van actium het schip van antonius tegenhield maakte he0.062502, t daardoor de verovering voor augustus gemakkelijk waarvan hangt toch dikwijls het lot der volken af
0.090909, "zou er brand aan boord zijn" vroeg ik mij zelven af
0.166667, "is het mogelijk" riep ik uit
0.142857, "maar dit kanaal zal zich eens vullen"
0.018868, de nautilus vervolgde kalm en snel als altijd zijn vaart midden door al deze wrakken heen den 19den februari 's morgens om drie uur waren wij de straat van gibraltar er zijn daar twee zeestroomen de bovenstroom dien men sedert lang kent voert het water van den oceaan naar de middellandsche zee doch0.020409,  een benedenstroom doet het tegenovergestelde zooals de wetenschap den laatsten tijd heeft bewezen de middellandsche zee toch neemt steeds toe door het water van den oceaan en de rivieren die er uitmonden haar peil zou dus jaarlijks vrij wat hooger worden want de uitdamping niet voldoende om het ev0.020834, enwicht te herstellen docht dit zoo niet zoodat men natuurlijk het bestaan van een benedenstroom heeft moeten aannemen die door de straat van gibraltar het overtollige water van de middellandsche zee naar den oceaan voert van dezen onderstroom maakte de nautilus gebruik hij schoot snel door de nauw0.024390, e zeestraat een oogenblik slechts zag ik de wonderschoone bouwvallen van den tempel van hercules die volgens plinius en avienus met het lage eiland waarop hij stond gezonken en weinige oogenblikken daarna dreven wij op de golven van den atlantischen oceaan
0.083333, ned land keek mij nog strakker aan en opende eindelijk den mond
0.021739, "wij waren overeengekomen een gelegenheid af te wachten" vervolgde ned land "die gelegenheid heb ik nu van avond zullen wij maar eenige kilometers van de spaansche kust verwijderd zijn de nacht donker de wind west ik heb uw woord mijnheer aronnax en ik reken op u"
0.018868, "wij zullen als gij wilt tot 1702 opklimmen mijnheer" hervatte de kapitein "gij weet toch dat op dit tijdstip uw koning lodewijk xiv meende dat wenk van dien dwingeland voldoende om de te doen wegzinken en zijn kleinzoon den hertog van anjou aan de spanjaarden als koning op te dringen deze vorst di0.058824, e onder den naam van philips v meer minder slecht regeerde tegen lastige vijanden buitenslands te kampen

0.018868, ned beproefde zijn woede om met het oog door den benevelden gezichteinder te boren hij hoopte nog dat zich achter dien nevel het zoo begeerde land uitstrekte om twaalf uur scheen de zon maar een oogenblik de stuurman maakte daarvan gebruik om de hoogte te nemen daar echter de zee te onstuimig werd 0.111111, gingen wij naar beneden en het luik werd gesloten
0.083334, "kom dan mee mijnheer de professor om onze scaphanders te gaan aandoen"
0.021277, het algemeen verschilden die visschen van den atlantischen oceaan weinig van die wij reeds gezien hadden het waren roggen van reusachtige gedaante vijf meter lang en zoo sterk dat zij boven water konden uitspringen haaien van verschillende soort onder anderen een van vijf meter lang met driehoekige0.142857,  scherpe tanden steuren zeepalingen en andere visschen
0.166667, "zijt gij het mijnheer de professor"
0.018182, ik sloot een oogenblik mijn oogen door het electrisch licht als verblind en zag om mij heen de nautilus lag stil aan een oever die als een kaai gevormd de zee waarop het vaartuig op dat oogenblik dreef een meer door een muur als 't ware ingesloten het een middellijn van ongeveer twee kilometer het 0.020000, peil zoo als de manometer aanwees stond gelijk met dat van de zee buiten dien muur zoodat er noodzakelijk gemeenschap tusschen het meer en de zee moest bestaan de hooge rotswanden waartusschen wij lagen ingesloten welfden zich boven ons en vormden als het ware een omgekeerden trechter van vijf zes 0.052632, honderd meter hoogte bovenin een opening waardoor ik de schemering gezien die waarschijnlijk aan het daglicht moest worden toegeschreven
0.035715, "en ik voeg er nog bij land dat het water dan ook den vulkaan niet binnengestroomd en deze nog een vuurspuwende berg wezen zou je spijt dus overbodig"
0.021277, ik sprong overeind en zag dat het zeewater als een stortvloed de grot binnendrong omdat wij wezenlijkheid geen weekdieren waren moesten wij trachten ons te redden binnen weinige oogenblikken waren wij boven de grot veiligheid "wat gebeurt er toch" vroeg koenraad "is er een nieuw wonder voorgevallen0.019231, "men kan" zegt hij "dat verschijnsel verklaren door een proef die elkeen kent als men een bak met water eenige stukjes kurk andere voorwerpen laat drijven en men aan het water een draaiende beweging geeft dan zal men die verspreide stukjes zich het midden zien bijeen voegen dat daar waar het water 0.033333, het minst beweging bij het verschijnsel waarover wij spreken de atlantische oceaan de bak de golfstroom het draaiend gedeelte en de krooszee het middelpunt waar de drijvende voorwerpen zich vereenigen"
0.066667, "visschen" antwoordde hij "zelden maar wat vermoedt weet men bij den tegenwoordigen staat der wetenschap"
0.041667, "de inhoud van den nautilus 1500 ton en een ton bevat duizend liter dus bevat de nautilus 1500000 liter lucht dat door 2400 gedeeld"
0.062500, "ik denk er zooals vriend ned" zei koenraad "en ik ben nieuwsgierig wat mijnheer zal antwoorden"
0.083333, "welnu kapitein" zei ik "dan het nog tijd het belang der walvisschen"
0.026316, "het onnoodig zich bloot te stellen mijnheer de professor de nautilus voldoende staat om die potvisschen te verdelgen hij met een stalen spoor gewapend die naar ik mij verbeeld wel tegen den harpoen van meester land kan opwegen"
0.040000, "het een verschrikkelijk schouwspel" zei de amerikaan wiens geestdrift vrij wat bekoeld "maar ik ben geen slager ik ben slechts jager en dit een slachting"
0.020833, doch om ronduit te spreken moet ik bekennen dat deze avontuurlijke tocht mij niet onaangenaam ik kan niet zeggen hoe mij de schoonheden van deze nieuwe streken verrukking brachten de ijsbergen namen prachtige gedaanten aan hier vormden zij een oostersche stad met ontelbare koepels en daar vormden z0.022222, ij als het ware een puin gestort oord dat door een aardbeving verwoest de gezichten veranderden elk oogenblik hetzij door den schuinen stand der zonnestralen hetzij door grauwen nevel sneeuwstormen dan hoorden wij van alle kanten vreeselijke knallen ineenstorting val van groote ijsbergen waardoor h0.142857, et landschap elk oogenblik van gedaante veranderde
0.020408, hier en daar staken scherpe punten tot op twee honderd voet hoogte uit verder zag ik een rij scherpe en hoekige grijs getinte klippen waarop enkele zonnestralen als een spiegel door den mist heen terugkaatsten en die eenzame natuur heerschte een doodsche stilte ter nauwernood soms afgebroken door h0.100000, et geklapwiek van een stormvogel alles bevroren zelfs het geluid
0.076923, "als uw kapitein nog verder gaat mijnheer" zei mij dien dag ned land
0.029412, "omdat niemand de ijsbank kan heenkomen uw kapitein bij de hand maar hij voor den duivel niet sterker dan de natuur en waar deze een grens heeft gesteld moet men men wil niet ophouden"
0.250000, "wat dan" vroeg ik
0.142857, "welnu mijnheer wat denkt gij er van"
0.020833, toen sprong hij op het strand hij zichtbaar ontroerd hij beklom een uitstekend rotspunt en daar stond hij met elkander geslagen armen een vurig oog onbeweeglijk en stilzwijgend als om bezit van deze streken te nemen toen hij zoo ongeveer vijf minuten gestaan keerde hij tot ons terug
0.019231, de sneeuwstorm duurde tot den volgenden dag het onmogelijk om op het plat te blijven staan den salon waar ik de bijzonderheden van onzen tocht opteekende hoorde ik het geschreeuw van stormvogels en albatrossen den orkaan de nautilus bleef niet stil liggen doch voer langs de kust voort en ging nog e0.041670, en tiental kilometer verder naar het zuiden te midden van een halve schemering veroorzaakt door dat de zon maar even boven den gezichteinder verscheen
0.030303, den volgenden dag 20 maart het sneeuwen opgehouden doch het vinniger koud de thermometer stond twee graad onder nul de mist trok op en ik hoopte dat wij dien dag zonshoogte konden nemen
0.071429, "zeker koen maar zeg eens heb jij op die schoone dieren nooit jacht gemaakt"
0.018868, om negen uur waren wij aan land de hemel werd helderder en de wolken dreven naar het zuiden de mist die op het water lag trok op kapitein nemo richtte den steven naar den bergtop waarvan hij misschien zijn observatorium wilde maken het beklimmen daarvan koste veel moeite door de puntige stukken lav0.020408, a en puimsteen te midden eener atmosfeer bedorven door opstijging van zwavelachtige dampen die hun kolommen tusschen de rotsspleten naar boven drongen voor iemand op het land niet meer gewoon beklom de kapitein de steile hellingen met een vlugheid en behendigheid die ik niet kon nabootsen en een ge0.200000, mzenjager hem zou benijd hebben
0.040000, ik wilde hem niet storen toen hij zich echter na eenige oogenblikken naar mij toekeerde vroeg ik hem het tegenovergestelde van mijn vraag de torresstraat
0.333333, "een toeval kapitein"
0.100000, "jawel" zei de kapitein terwijl hij naar de deur ging
0.250000, "maar wat er dan"
0.200000, "wij gaan terug" riep koenraad
0.076923, "ja" antwoordde ik "de tunnel schijnt aan die zijde geen opening te hebben"
0.090911, "goed zoo ned" zei ik terwijl ik hem de hand toestak
0.029414, "en ik voeg er nog bij" hernam hij "dat ik even goed het houweel als den harpoen hanteer en dat als de kapitein denkt dat ik hem nuttig kan zijn hij mij kan beschikken"
0.027027, echter hadden wij twaalf uren tijds maar meter dikte van het ijs opgeruimd als dus het werk op dezelfde wijze werd doorgezet dan zouden wij nog vijf nachten en vier dagen hebben noodig gehad om te eindigen
0.040000, "in allen gevalle" voegde koenraad er bij "is die kapitein een baas en wij behoeven er geen berouw te gevoelen hem te hebben leeren kennen"

0.019608, van de groote planten waarvan ik met ned en koen zat te praten kwamen wij natuurlijk op reusachtige zeedieren het eene dier blijkbaar bestemd om het andere te verslinden door de ramen van den bijna stilliggenden nautilus zagen wij evenwel niet veel anders dan kleine beesten toen ned land mijn aanda0.083333, cht vestigde op een schrikkelijk gewemel tusschen het groote en hooge zeewier
0.020408, "niets mijn vrienden niets althans wat de grenzen der waarschijnlijkheid te buiten gaat om aan fabels legenden te gelooven doch er moet voor de van die vertellers een oorzaak ten minste een voorwendsel bestaan men kan niet ontkennen dat er inktvisschen van zeer groote afmeting bestaan doch zij zijn0.021277,  toch altijd kleiner dan walvisschen aristoteles spreekt van een inktvisch van vijf ellebogen dat 31 meter onze visschers zien er dikwijls die langer zijn dan 180 de museums van en montpellier bewaren skeletten van inktvisschen die twee meter lang zijn bovendien zouden volgens de bewering van natuu0.041667, rkenners dieren die maar twee meter lang zijn voelarmen van negen meter hebben en dat genoeg om er een vreeselijk monster van te maken"

0.166667, "wat dat dan" vroeg de amerikaan
0.027027, "dat geen reden" antwoordde ik "de voelarmen en de staart van deze dieren groeien telkens opnieuw aan en zeven jaren tijds heeft de staart van den inktvisch van bouguer zeker tijd genoeg gehad om aan te groeien"
0.062500, "bovendien" antwoordde koenraad "als dit dier het al niet dan het misschien een van deze hier"
0.028571, aanstonds kwam een van die voelarmen als een slang door de opening en twintig anderen kronkelden daarboven met een bijlslag hieuw de kapitein den vreeselijken voelarm af die kronkelend langs de trappen naar beneden gleed
