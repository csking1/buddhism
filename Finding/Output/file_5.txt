0.058824, koenraad en hij gingen eindelijk uit de cel waarin zij meer dan dertig uur hadden opgesloten gezeten
0.020000, ik volgde kapitein nemo en zoodra ik den drempel trad kwamen wij een soort van electrisch verlichten gang na eenige schreden voortgegaan te zijn opende zich eene tweede deur ik kwam toen eene eetzaal welke met smaak versierd en gemeubeld aan de beide uiteinden der zaal stonden hooge eikenhouten buf0.027778, fetten met ebbenhout ingelegd op wier uitgeschulpte planken kostbaar aardewerk porselein en glaswerk prijkte het servies schittterde onder de lichtstralen die naar beneden vielen van eene zoldering waarvan de zachte kleuren het scherpe licht eenigszins temperden

0.052632, "dan begrijp ik niet hoe gij de nautilus zoo diep kunt doen indompelen gij moest haar geheel laten volloopen"
0.020408, "als gij op duizend meter diepte zijt dan ondervindt het buitenste bekleedsel van de nautilus eene drukking van honderd atmosferen als gij dus op dat oogenblik het water uit uwe vergaarbakken wilt verdrijven om weder te stijgen dan moeten uwe pompen die drukking overwinnen en dat honderd kilogram o0.100000, p de vierkante centimeter gij hebt dus eene kracht noodig"

0.019608, "ik keek den kapitein van de nautilus aan met een gezicht dat alles behalve vleiend voor zijn persoon ik dacht dat zijne hersens gekrenkt waren dat hij een aanval van waanzin gehad die acht dagen en dat die zelfs nog voortduurde het jammer ik toch liever met zijne vreemdsoortige eigenaardigheden te0.200002,  doen dan met een gek

0.090909, terwijl de kapitein die volzinnen uitsprak zeide ik bij mij zelven
0.200000, "mijnheer moet maar eens zien"
0.022222, deze baai waar wij verscheiden malen de netten uitwierpen leverde een overvloed van voortreffelijke oesters op wij aten er onbehoorlijk veel en maakten ze volgens seneca's voorschrift zelven aan tafel open de oesterbank van wailea moet verbazend groot zijn en zonder veelvuldige oorzaken van verniet0.020833, iging zou die opeenstapeling van schelpdieren eindigen met de geheele baai te vullen omdat een dier tot zelfs twee millioen eieren kan bevatten indien ned land bij die gelegenheid geen berouw zijne gulzigheid dan komt het daarvandaan dat de oesters het eenige eten dat minder eene indigestie veroorz0.032258, aakt inderdaad men moet niet minder dan zestien dozijn van die schelpdieren hebben om de 315 gram stikstofhoudend voedsel te verkrijgen welke voor het dagelijksch onderhoud van een mensch noodig zijn
0.200000, "ja mijnheer" antwoordde de kapitein

0.022727, "mijnheer" antwoordde hij "geloof mij als ik u zeg dat dit stuk ijzer nooit meer op onder zee varen zal het goed om bij 't pond verkocht te worden ik geloof dat het oogenblik gekomen om dien kapitein nemo de hakken te laten zien"
0.041667, "het allen gevalle te wagen" zeide koenraad "en dan weten wij met een waaraan wij ons ten opzichte van zijne vriendelijkheid te houden hebben"

0.200000, "ontbreekt u niets" vroeg koenraad
0.020833, na een niet zeer dicht kreupelhout te zijn doorgegaan vonden wij eene vlakte met heesters bedekt daar zag ik prachtige vogels opvliegen wier lange vederen hen noodzaakten om tegen den wind te vliegen hunne dwarrelende vlucht de bevalligheid der bochten welke zij de lucht beschreven de schittering h0.090909, unner kleuren trokken bijzonder onze aandacht ik herkende ze zonder moeite
0.200000, "bravo koen bravo" riep ik
0.043478, "is hij dan zeldzaam" vroeg de amerikaan op den toon van een jager die uit een wetenschappelijk oogpunt zeer weinig om wild geeft
0.020000, al aan mijne begeerte nu voldaan door het bezit van een paradijsvogel de wensch van den amerikaanschen jager nog volstrekt niet vervuld gelukkig velde ned land tegen twee uur een groot boschvarken dat de inlanders barioutang noemen het dier kwam goed van pas om ons wezenlijk vleesch van een viervoe0.052632, tig dier te verschaffen ned trotsch op zijn schot het varken door den electrieken kogel getroffen mors dood gevallen
0.017241, den 8sten januari ging ik 's morgens om zes uur op het plat de dag brak aan toen de morgennevel optrok zag ik eerst het strand en toen de toppen der bergen de wilden waren er nog altijd doch talrijker dan den vorigen dag vijf zes honderd misschien eenigen maakten gebruik van het lage tij en waren v0.019231, an de eene klip op de andere springende tot op twee kabellengten van de nautilus gekomen ik zag ze zeer duidelijk het waren wel degelijk papoea's van athletische gedaante menschen van een schoon ras met een hoog en breed voorhoofd een dikken doch geen platten neus en met witte tanden hun wolachtig 0.019608, haar rood geverfd en stak vreemd af tegen hunne huid die zwart en glimmend als van de nubiers aan hunne doorstoken en uitgerekte oorlellen hingen trossen beentjes zij waren het algemeen naakt ik zag eenige vrouwen onder hen die eene wezenlijke crinoline van gedroogd gras aan hadden welke tot aan de0.020000,  reikte sommige opperhoofden hadden hun hals met een halve maan en met snoeren van roode en witte glaskoralen versierd bijna allen waren met bogen pijlen en schilden gewapend en droegen een soort van netje op den rug waarin zij de ronde steenen bewaarden welke zij met groote behendigheid wisten te 0.100000, "deze schelp" zeide ik hem het voorwerp mijner blijdschap toonende
0.083333, "o die schavuit ik wilde liever dat hij mij den arm verbrijzeld"
0.021277, "die d'urville een van uwe grootste zeelieden" zeide de kapitein "een van de verstandigste zeevaarders het een fransche cook ongelukkige geleerde de ijsbanken aan de zuidpool de koraalriffen en de kannibalen den grooten oceaan getrotseerd te hebben om ellendig een spoortrein om te komen als die kra0.050001, chtige man de laatste oogenblikken van zijn leven heeft kunnen denken wie weet wat die laatste gedachten dan geweest zijn"
0.018868, ik bleef tot twaalf uur mijne kamer zitten werken zonder den kapitein slechts een oogenblik gezien te hebben men scheen aan boord geen enkel toebereidsel te maken om te vertrekken ik wachtte nog eenigen tijd en ging toen naar het salon de pendule wees half drie tien minuten moest de vloed zijne gro0.031250, otste hoogte bereikt hebben en als de kapitein geen dwaze belofte gedaan dan zou de nautilus onmiddellijk vlot raken anders zouden er heel wat maanden verloopen voordat zij deze klippen verlaten kon
0.200000, "wij gaan vertrekken" zeide hij
0.166667, "begrijpt gij mij niet" vroeg hij
0.023810, gedurende dit gedeelte der reis nam de kapitein belangrijke proeven voor den verschillenden warmtegraad der zee op onderscheiden diepte gewoonlijk verkrijgt men die gegevens met vrij samengestelde instrumenten wier opgaven op zijn minst genomen twijfelachtig zijn hetzij men daartoe peilingen doet m0.022728, et thermometers wier glazen buizen dikwijls door den druk van het water breken hetzij men dit ten uitvoer brengt met werktuigen wier samenstelling gegrond op de veranderlijkheid van weerstand der metalen tegen de electrieke stroomen de aldus verkregen resultaten kunnen niet genoegzaam worden nagere0.032259, kend kapitein nemo ging die temperatuur daarentegen de diepten der zee zelve zoeken zijn thermometer daar met het water aanraking gebracht gaf hem aanstonds en met groote juistheid de verlangde aanwijzing
0.020833, zoo gingen wij voort en werden elk oogenblik door nieuwe wonderen verrukking gebracht koenraad keek zijne oogen uit en deed niets als geleede dieren weekdieren en visschen klassen ordenen de dagen gingen snel voorbij ik telde ze niet eens meer volgens zijne gewoonte trachtte ned voortdurend ons men0.018182, u af te wisselen wij hadden veel van slakken die voor deze schelp gemaakt waren en ik moet bekennen dat het op die wijze gemakkelijk om eene slak te worden wij sleten dus een gemakkelijk en natuurlijk leven en verbeeldden ons dat dit niet zeer verschilde van het leven op het land toen eene gebeurte0.125000, nis ons het vreemde van onzen toestand herinnerde
0.100000, "zal mijnheer mij kunnen zeggen wat dit beteekent" vroeg koenraad
0.019231, ik liet den kapitein de hut van den stervende en ging ontroerd van dit tooneel naar mijne kamer ik werd gedurende den ganschen dag door sombere voorgevoelens gekweld dien nacht sliep ik slecht en mijn dikwijls afgebroken slaap meende ik de verte te hooren zuchten en lijkzangen zingen dit soms het g0.111111, ebed voor stervenden die taal welke ik niet begreep
0.020000, de kapitein trad eene sombere galerij binnen welke ons langs eene helling tot op meer dan honderd meter diepte voerde het licht onzer lantaarns bracht soms eene tooverachtige werking te weeg als het op de ruwe punten van dit natuurlijke gewelf en op de hangende koraalbrokken scheen wier uiteinden d0.200000, an op vurige punten geleken

0.020834, de netten van den nautilus haalden verscheiden soorten van zeeschildpadden op wier schaal voor zeer kostbaar wordt gehouden die kruipende dieren duiken gemakkelijk onder water en kunnen lang onder blijven als zij de vleezige klep maar sluiten welke zij aan het einde van den neus hebben sommige van 0.028571, die dieren sliepen nog toen men ze ving en waren hun schild gedoken om daardoor veilig te zijn tegen andere zeedieren hun vleesch smaakte het algemeen slechts middelmatig doch de eieren waren een uitgezochte lekkernij
0.025000, "wij zijn er aan gewoon" antwoordde de kapitein "en mettertijd zult gij het ook zijn overigens zijt gij gewapend en misschien zullen wij dan onderweg wel op een haai jacht maken het een belangwekkende jacht dus tot morgen vroeg mijnheer"
0.038462, "jongens mijnheer" zei ned land "uw kapitein nemo de duivel hale hem heeft ons een zeer aardige uitnoodiging gedaan" "o zoo" zei ik "gij weet dus"

0.111111, "althans als de nautilus niet land de landengte heengaat"

0.062500, "daar" riep de amerikaan "nu ligt het dier op den rug met de borsten de lucht"
0.055556, "o mijnheer" riep hij met een stem die van aandoening beefde "zoo iets heb ik nog nooit gedood"
0.052632, "slechts dit raad ik u" hernam de kapitein "dat gij het dier zeker treft en dit uw eigen belang"
0.055556, "jawel" zei ik "het dier gewond daar drijft bloed maar je wapen hem niet het lichaam blijven zitten"
0.034483, tegen vijf uur 's avonds waren wij op de hoogte van kaap ras mohammed zij vormt het uiteinde van steenachtig en ligt tusschen de golven van suez en akabah
0.037037, tegen zeven uur kwamen ned en koenraad weer bij mij de beide onafscheidelijke vrienden hadden stil geslapen zonder zich met de heldendaden van den nautilus te bemoeien
0.125000, "ik geloof er niets van" antwoordde de amerikaan
0.034483, "bovendien ned kapitein nemo heeft mij zijn tunnel leeren kennen en ik bij hem de hut van den stuurman toen hij zelf den nautilus door dezen nauwen doorgang stuurde"
0.166667, "hoor je het ned" zei koenraad
0.200000, de amerikaan keek nauwkeurig toe
0.047619, "mijnheer" hervatte ned "veronderstellen wij eens het onmogelijke dat namelijk de kapitein u heden de vrijheid aanbood zoudt gij die aannemen"
0.166667, "ik weet het niet" antwoordde ik
0.018868, midden zee verscheen plotseling een man een duiker die een klein leeren zakje aan zijn gordel droeg het geen lijk dat met den stroom voortdreef het een levend mensch die met krachtige hand voortzwom en nu en dan verdween om aan de oppervlakte adem te scheppen doch aanstonds weer naar beneden dook i0.017242, k keerde mij met bewogen stem tot den kapitein "een man een drenkeling" riep ik "wij moeten hem redden" de kapitein antwoordde niet en kwam bij het raam de man zwom naar ons toe drukte het gelaat tegen het glas en keek ons aan tot mijn groote verbazing gaf de kapitein hem een teeken de duiker gaf m0.076923, et een wenk antwoord steeg onmiddellijk naar boven en kwam niet weer terug
0.033333, "laat ik eerst uitspreken mijnheer als dit verschijnsel eens plaats vond zou het onaangenaam zijn voor mijnheer de lesseps die zich zooveel moeite geeft om de landengte door te graven"
0.020000, "van avond om negen uur" fluisterde hij "ik heb koen gewaarschuwd dan zal de kapitein waarschijnlijk zijn kamer en naar bed zijn de machinisten en matrozen kunnen ons niet zien koenraad en ik zullen naar de hoofdtrap gaan gij mijnheer aronnax zult een paar schreden afstands de bibliotheek wachten o0.020000, p ons teeken de riemen de mast en de zeilen zijn al de sloep ik heb er zelfs eenige levensmiddelen kunnen brengen ook heb ik mij van een sleutel meester gemaakt om de bouten los te schroeven die de boot aan den nautilus verbinden alles dus gereed tot van avond"
0.026316, mijn oog vestigde zich toen op het kompas wij voeren altijd naar het noorden de log wees een matige snelheid aan de manometer een diepte van ongeveer twintig meter de omstandigheden begunstigden dus het plan van den amerikaan
0.018519, ik ging weer naar mijn kamer trok warme kleederen aan zeelaarzen een muts van otterbont een wambuis met het vel van een zeekalf gevoerd ik gereed ik wachtte het geraas van de schroef brak alleen de stilte die aan boord heerschte ik luisterde en spitste de ooren zou mij het gerucht van stemmen niet 0.037037, doen vernemen dat ned land zijn plannen verhinderd en overvallen een doodelijke ongerustheid maakte zich van mij meester ik trachtte te vergeefs mijn kalmte terug te krijgen
0.020000, "spanje moest zich tegen deze beslissing verzetten maar het bijna geheel van soldaten en matrozen beroofd geld echter ontbrak niet als de galjoenen die met het goud en zilver van amerika bevracht waren maar de havens binnenliepen tegen het einde van 1712 wachtte men een rijk konvooi dat de fransche0.045455,  regeering door een vloot van 23 oorlogschepen onder den admiraal de liet begeleiden omdat de oorlogsvloten der verbondenen den atlantischen oceaan kruisten
0.076923, ik deze woorden niet uitgesproken ik begreep dat ik kapitein nemo moeten grieven
0.020000, kapitein nemo zweeg plotseling en er misschien berouw te veel gezegd te hebben ik het echter geraden welke ook de beweegredenen mochten geweest zijn die hem gedrongen hadden op zee de onafhankelijkheid te zoeken hij toch voor alles mensch gebleven zijn hart klopte nog warm voor het lijden der mensc0.066667, hheid en zijn oneindig groote liefde strekte zich slaafsche volken zoowel als enkele personen uit
0.021277, terwijl ik zoo peinsde en al de bijzonderheden van dit grootsche landschap mijn geheugen trachtte te prenten bleef kapitein nemo op een met mos bedekte kolom geleund onbeweeglijk en als versteend stomme bewondering staan dacht hij aan verdwenen geslachten en trachtte hij het geheim der toekomst van0.020000,  het menschdom te ontdekken kwam die vreemde man op deze plaats zijn geschiedkundige herinneringen verlevendigen en deze oudheid mee leven omdat hij van het leven den lateren nieuweren tijd niets wilde weten wat zou ik niet gegeven hebben om zijn gedachten te kennen daarin te deelen en ze te begrij0.052633, "maar vriend ned" zei koenraad "als die opening niet onder water dan de nautilus hier niet binnen kunnen komen"
0.125000, "best" zei ik "maar laat ons nu voortgaan"
0.020000, deze tweede tak van den warmen stroom gaat dus met zijn golven om een koud bijna stilstaand en onbeweeglijk gedeelte van den oceaan dat men de krooszee noemt het een meer het midden van den oceaan om hetwelk het water van den grooten stroom niet minder dan drie jaar heenloopt
0.019608, ik keek weer op den manometer deze wees een diepte van zes kilometer aan wij waren sedert een uur aan het dalen de nautilus daalde altijd door het ontvolkte water bijzonder doorschijnend en onbeschrijfelijk helder een uur later waren wij dertien kilometer diep en nog bemerkten wij niets van den bod0.021277, em der zee toen wij echter veertien kilometer gedaald waren begon ik zwarte bergtoppen te zien die naar boven staken maar dat konden wel toppen van bergen zijn zoo hoog als de himalaya de montblanc misschien nog hooger en dan bleef de diepte van deze afgronden onberekenbaar
0.062500, "ik wil zeggen dat niets gemakkelijker dan een photogram van deze onderzeesche streken mee te nemen"
0.052632, dien dag 14 maart kwamen koenraad en hij mijn kamer ik vroeg hen naar de oorzaak van hunne komst
0.125000, "dat kan ik u niet zeggen mijn vriend"
0.083333, koenraad eindigde zijn zin niet maar ik begreep waar hij heen wilde
0.333333, "625" herhaalde ned
0.111111, "dat nog te veel voor drie menschen" mompelde koenraad
0.023256, toen wij tegen elf uur des morgens boven dreven kwam de nautilus tusschen een troep walvisschen een ontmoeting die mij niet verwonderde omdat ik wist dat deze dieren door felle jachten tot het uiterste gedreven naar ver het noorden zuiden gelegen gevlucht zijn
0.017545, "omdat zij even als de andere visschen den staart toen dwars hadden staan dat te zeggen dat hun staart vertikaal stond en het water links en rechts weg sloeg maar toen de schepper zag dat zij te snel zwommen draaide hij hun den staart om en sedert dien tijd slaan zij van boven naar beneden het wate0.142857, r tot groot nadeel voor hun snelheid"
0.037037, "niet al te veel" antwoordde ned "niet meer ten minste dan toen ik u zei dat er walvisschen van honderd meter lang en honderdduizend kilo zwaar zijn"
0.032258, "dat werkelijk nog al veel" zei ik "maar men moet toch erkennen dat sommige walvisschen verbazend groot worden als men hoort dat zulk een beest soms tot honderdtwintig ton traan geeft"
0.020000, welk een strijd ned land zelf verrukking en klapte de handen de nautilus slechts reusachtige harpoen door de hand van den kapitein gedrild het schip vloog tegen die vleezige massa's aan doorboorde ze geheel en al zoodat er na dien stoot slechts twee afzichtelijke helften van het dier overbleven het0.018519,  geen gevoel van de vreeselijke slagen welke de potvisschen er met den staart tegen gaven evenmin van de stooten die het uitdeelde als een potvisch gedood wierp de nautilus zich op een ander ten einde zijn prooi niet te missen vloog gehoorzaam aan het roer voor en achteruit dook als de visch naar d0.025641, e diepte zwom kwam er weer mee boven als de potvisch naar de oppervlakte vluchtte trof hem 't midden schuins sneed het beest scheurde het van elkander sloeg de monsters allerlei richtingen en allerhande houdingen met zijn geweldige spoor
0.200000, kapitein nemo kwam bij ons
0.043479, "ik meen dat wij noch voor noch achteruit noch ergens heen kunnen dit noemt men geloof ik 'vast zitten' ten minster onder beschaafde
0.025641, "neen mijnheer" antwoordde hij "maar wij zullen die samen ontdekken waar anderen schipbreuk hebben geleden zal ik slagen ik heb den nautilus nog nimmer zoover de zuidelijke ijszee gewaagd doch ik herhaal het u wij zullen nog verder gaan"
0.066667, en ned land ging naar zijn hut "om geen ongeluk te begaan" zooals hij zei
0.045455, eindelijk om zes uur 's morgens op dien gedenkwaardigen 20sten maart opende zich de deur van den salon en kapitein nemo verscheen
0.058824, eenige riemslagen brachten ons aan het strand toen koenraad aan land wilde springen hield ik hem tegen
0.083333, "drommels" zei koenraad "het gelukkig dat ned land niet bij ons is"
0.142857, "omdat die dolle harpoenier alles zou doodslaan"
0.018868, het acht uur wij moesten nog vier uur wachten voor wij de zon zouden kunnen waarnemen ik ging naar een uitgestrekte baai die een inham vormde de granietrotsen op den oever zoover ons gezicht reikte waren de oevers van de ijsschotsen met zeedieren bedekt en onwillekeurig zag ik uit naar den ouden pr0.019608, oteus den herder die volgens de fabelleer de kudden van neptunus weidde het waren meestal zeekalven de wijfjes pasten op de jongen de mannetjes hielden de wacht als zij van de eene plaats naar de andere gingen deden zij kleine sprongen en steunden daarbij gedeeltelijk op hun zwemvliezen die bij de 0.020408, met hen verwante zeekoeien veel hadden van armen ik moet erkennen dat die dieren met hun bevallige bewegingen en gladharige huid verwonderlijk zwommen als zij op het strand lagen namen zij allerlei bevallige houdingen aan het dus geen wonder dat de ouden ze dichterlijk met tritons en sirenen vergel0.052632, eken er waren er onder die men omdat zij een lengte van zes tot zeven meter bereikten zeeolifanten noemt
0.250000, "en hoe kwam dit"
0.166667, "zullen wij weer voort kunnen varen"
0.125000, "zoo iets ik nooit kunnen gelooven" zei koenraad
0.055556, "mijne heeren" zei hij op bedaarden toon "er zijn twee wijzen van sterven de omstandigheden waarin wij verkeeren"
0.018869, ik bracht den amerikaan naar het vertrek waar de mannen van den nautilus bezig waren de scaphanders aan te doen ik deelde den kapitein neds voorstel mede dat hij aannam de amerikaan trok een scaphander aan en even spoedig als de anderen gereed elk hunner droeg een toestel van rouquayrol met een voo0.034483, rraad zuivere lucht op den rug de vergaarbakken van den nautilus werden daardoor nog al beroofd doch 't noodig de lampen van ruhmkorff waren onnoodig dit electrisch verlichte water
0.021277, "ik weet het mijnheer wij moeten derhalve niet rekenen op de hulp der natuur maar op ons zelven wij moeten dat invriezen beletten niet naderen ons de zijmuren doch en achter ons hebben wij niet veel meer dan tien voet water aan alle kanten vriezen wij in"
0.076923, "hoe lang kunnen wij met behulp van de luchtvergaarbakken nog ademhalen" vroeg ik
0.021739, de kranen der vergaarbakken werden toen wagewijd open gezet en honderd kubieke meters water stroomden naar binnen waardoor de zwaarte van den nautilus met 150000 kilogrammen vermeerderde wij wachtten wij luisterden en vergaten gespannen verwachting ons lijden ons behoud stond als 't ware op een laa0.500000, tsten worp
0.035714, ik keek naar de klok het elf uur den morgen wij moesten dus 28 maart hebben de nautilus voer met een duizelingwekkende snelheid van veertig kilometer per uur
0.166667, van kaap hoorn naar de amazonenrivier
0.125000, "waarvan ik misbruik zal maken" antwoordde de amerikaan
0.125000, "dat zou ik je niet kunnen zeggen ned"
0.200000, "dat een flinke barometer vriend"
0.111111, "die oude bisschoppen konden goed liegen" zei ned land
0.083333, "en vischt men ze nu nog wel eens op" vroeg ned land
0.041667, "ja mijnheer de schroef zit vast ik geloof dat de voelarmen van een van die dieren er tusschen zit daarom kunnen wij niet vooruit"
0.019231, gingen er tien dagen voorbij het eerst den derden mei dat de nautilus weer rechte lijn naar het noorden voer nadat wij vooraf bij het kanaal van bahama de eilanden nogmaals het gezicht hadden gehad wij volgden toen den loop van den grooten zeestroom die zijn oevers zijn eigenaardige visschen en bij0.166667, zondere temperatuur heeft dit de golfstroom
0.500000, "ja mijnheer"
0.037037, "maar de slaaf behoudt toch overal het recht om de vrijheid te herkrijgen welke ook de middelen zijn die zich daarvoor aanbieden hij mag ze allen aangrijpen"
0.032258, wat rechtvaardigt die golfstroom zijn naam het vaderland der stormen te zijn hier worden die vreeselijke cyklonen gevormd door het verschil de temperatuur van de luchtlagen die boven de stroomen liggen
0.019608, den volgenden dag 31 mei deed de nautilus nog hetzelfde het duidelijk dat hij een bepaald punt van den oceaan opzocht kapitein nemo kwam zonshoogte nemen evenals hij den vorigen dag gedaan de zee kalm de hemel helder acht kilometer oostwaarts van ons zag ik een groot stoomschip aan den gezichteinde0.019608, r het toonde geen vlag zoodat ik niet kon zien tot welke natie het behoorde kapitein nemo nam eenige minuten de zon door den meridiaan ging zijn sextant en keek met de grootste oplettendheid de kalmte der zee maakte zijn waarnemingen des te gemakkelijker de nautilus lag onbeweeglijk en slingerde st0.055556, ootte niet ik stond op dat oogenblik op het plat toen de waarneming afgeloopen zei de kapitein slechts
0.500000, "hier het"'
0.333333, hij antwoordde niet
0.090909, "zij zien ons dus niet voor schipbreukelingen aan op een vlot"
0.021277, wij konden niets anders doen dan gehoorzamen een vijftiental matrozen van den nautilus omringden den kapitein en beschouwden het naderend vaartuig met een onverzoenlijk gevoel van haat men begreep dat dezelfde dorst naar wraak hen allen bezielde ik ging naar beneden op het oogenblik dat een nieuwe 0.090909, kogel weer op den nautilus afsprong en hoorde den kapitein roepen
0.020000, wij gingen de bibliotheek op het oogenblik dat ik de deur opende die naar de middeltrap geleidde hoorde ik het luik plotseling toeslaan de amerikaan vloog de trap op doch ik hield hem tegen een welbekend gesis deed ons hooren dat het water de vergaarbakken werd gepompt inderdaad weinige oogenblikke0.020000, n daarna de nautilus eenige nieters onder het vlak der zee gezonken ik begreep die beweging het te laat om te handelen de nautilus dacht er niet aan om den tweedekker zijn ondoordringbaar pantser te treffen maar wel onder de waterlijn waar de metalen huid het houtwerk niet meer beschermde
0.020408, wij waren opnieuw opgesloten en gedwongen getuigen van het treurspel dat zou aanvangen bovendien hadden wij nauwelijks tijd om na te denken mijn kamer gevlucht keken wij elkander aan zonder een woord te spreken mijn geest geheel verstomd ik kon niet meer denken ik den vreeselijken toestand die een 0.020408, ontzettende uitbarsting vooraf gaat ik hoorde ik luisterde ik geheel en al gehoor evenwel nam de snelheid van den nautilus sterk toe hij nam op die wijze zijn aanloop het geheele vaartuig trilde plotseling gaf ik een schreeuw een betrekkelijk geringe schok plaats ik voelde de doordringende kracht v0.018868, an de spoor ik hoorde gekraak en geknars maar de nautilus door groote kracht voortgestuwd ging door het schip heen als een mes door een stuk deeg ik kon het niet langer uitstaan ontsteld en geheel ontdaan vloog ik mijn kamer uit en den salon binnen daar kapitein nemo zwijgend somber onverzoenlijk z0.019231, ag hij door het raam aan bakboordzijde een groote massa zonk het water en om niets van den doodstrijd te verliezen daalde de nautilus met het schip naar de diepte op tien meter afstands zag ik de doorboorde kiel waar het water met donderend geweld binnendrong daarna de beide rijen geschutpoorten en0.022728,  de verschansingen het dek vol zwarte gedaanten die doodsangst heen en weer liepen het water rees de ongelukkigen vlogen het want grepen zich aan de masten vast wrongen nog onder water de handen het een menschelijk mierennest dat plotseling door de zee werd verzwolgen
0.025641, ik keerde mij naar den kapitein de vreeselijke rechter wezenlijke aartsengel van den haat staarde nog altijd naar zijn slachtoffers toen alles gedaan ging kapitein nemo naar zijn kamer en trad die binnen ik volgde hem met de oogen
0.500000, hoofdstuk xlvi
0.333332, "welk land het"
0.021277, ik tot alles besloten de amerikaan verliet mij ik ging naar het plat waarop ik door den zwaren golfslag ter nauwernood kon blijven staan de zee stond dreigend maar omdat daar achter dien nevel land lag moesten wij vluchten wij moesten geen dag geen uur zelfs verliezen
0.020834, men weet dat op het oogenblik van den vloed het water dat tusschen de eilanden en de loffoden opeengedrongen met onweerstaanbaar geweld voortstroomt het vormt een draaikolk waar nimmer een schip uit kunnen komen van alle kanten stroomen monsterachtige groote golven aan zij vormen den afgrond die de0.030303, n juisten naam draagt van "navel van den oceaan" en wiens aantrekkingskracht zich nog op een afstand van vijftien kilometer laat gevoelen daar worden schepen ja zelfs walvisschen en ijsberen uit de meegesleept
0.021277, hierheen nu de nautilus (misschien wel met opzet) door den kapitein heengevoerd en beschreef een spiraal waarvan de kringen al kleiner en kleiner werden de sloep die nog vast zat werd met duizelingwekkende snelheid meegevoerd ik voelde het ik ondervond de onaangename gewaarwording die het gevolg va0.020408, n een langdurig draaiende beweging wij waren vreeselijk ontsteld en onze angst zoo hoog mogelijk geklommen het bloed stolde ons de aderen onze zenuwen waren gespannen het koude zweet brak ons uit wat vreeselijk geweld rondom onze sloep welk geloei dat de echo zeker eenige kilometers ver herhaalde w0.020834, elk getier maakte het water als het tegen de scherpe rotspunten op den bodem aansloeg waarop zelfs de hardste voorwerpen verbrijzeld worden welk een toestand wij werden vreeselijk heen en weer geslingerd de nautilus verdedigde zich als een mensch de stalen banden en platen kraakten soms verhief hij0.166668,  zich weer en wij met hem
0.032258, nauwelijks hij dit gezegd een vreeselijk gekraak liet zich hooren de schroeven braken af en de sleep van het schip afgescheurd werd te midden van de draaikolk als een steen weggeslingerd
