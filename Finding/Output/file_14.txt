0.020833, bij mijne komst te newyork hadden verschillende personen mij de eer aangedaan om mij het wonderbaarlijk verschijnsel te raadplegen ik frankrijk een werk uitgegeven twee kwartijnen waarvan de titel luidde "de geheimen van de diepten der zee" dit boek nog al den smaak der geleerden gevallen en verhie0.019231, f mij tot eene specialiteit dat vrij onbekende deel der natuurlijke geschiedenis men vroeg mij om raad voor zoover als ik het wezenlijke van de zaak begrijpen kon bepaalde ik mij tot eene volstrekte ontkenning maar weldra dreef men mij zoo het nauw dat ik mij bepaald moest uitdrukken de "hoog gelee0.050000, rde pierre aronnax hoogleeraar aan het museum te parijs" werd door den "newyork herald" genoodzaakt zijne meening uit te spreken
0.022222, eindelijk liet ik mij dwingen ik sprak omdat ik niet meer zwijgen kon ik bekeek de zaak van alle kanten zoowel staatkundig als wetenschappelijk en ik geef hier slechts het slot van een zeer uitvoerig artikel dat ik het nommer van den 30sten april schreef
0.020408, derhalve wist men niet waarheen het fregat gezonden moest worden nu het voor een verren tocht uitgerusten van verbazende vischtoestellen voorzien men werd hoe langer hoe ongeduldiger toen men den 2den juli vernam dat de tampico eene boot van san francisco naar shanghai het dier drie weken geleden w0.022727, ederom het noordelijk gedeelte van de stille zuidzee gezien de ontroering welke deze tijding veroorzaakte buitengemeen groot men liet den kapitein farragut geen vierentwintig uur beraad zijne victualie aan boord hij kolen overvloed niemand ontbrak er op de scheepsrol hij behoefde zijn schip slechts0.037037,  onder stoom te brengen en het anker te lichten men zou hem een dag oponthoud kwalijk genomen hebben bovendien verlangde de kapitein niets liever dan te vertrekken
0.020000, die jongen dertig jaar oud zijn leeftijd stond tot die van zijn meester als 3 tot 4 ik behoef dus niet te zeggen dat ik 40 jaar oud koenraad slechts gebrek hij nam de vormen tot het bespottelijke acht zoodat hij mij altijd den derden persoon aanspraksoms tot tergens toe
0.022222, onze bagage werd onmiddellijk op het dek van het fregat gebracht ik haastte mij aan boord te komen en vroeg naar den kapitein een der matrozen bracht mij op de kampanje waar ik een officier vond met een goed voorkomen die mij de hand toestak
0.028571, de vloot van scheepjes en booten volgde het fregat nog altijd en verliet het niet eer dan op de hoogte van het vuurschip welks beide lichten den ingang van het nauwe vaarwater te newyork aanduiden
0.018868, kapitein farragut een flink zeeman en het fregat waard dat hij commandeerde zijn schip en hij vormden slechts een geheel hij er de ziel van hij twijfelde geen oogenblik aan het bestaan van den eenhoorn en hij duldde niet dat men daarover aan boord twistte hij geloofde er aan zooals sommige oude wij0.019608, ven aan het bestaan van den leviathan gelooven uit geloofsovertuiging niet door redeneering het monster bestond hij zou er de zee van bevrijden dit hij gezworen het een soort van ridder van rhodus een de gozon die de slang opzocht welke dit eiland verwoestte de kapitein zou den eenhoorn dooden dit 0.020408, dier zou den kapitein dooden een middelweg bestond er niet de officieren deelden het gevoelen van den commandant men ze eens moeten hooren spreken de verschillende kansen eener ontmoeting en den uitgestrekten oceaan zien bekijken meer dan een hield vrijwillig de wacht op de bramsteng die zulk een b0.020409, aantje onder andere omstandigheden zou verwenscht hebben zoolang de zon hare dagelijksche loopbaan aan den hemel beschreef zat het want vol matrozen wien de planken onder de voeten brandden zoodat zij op het dek niet konden blijven staan en toch kliefde de abraham lincoln de golven van den grooten 0.333333, oceaan nog niet
0.021277, ik heb reeds gezegd dat kapitein farragut het fregat zorgvuldig voorzien van allerlei werktuigen om den grooten visch te vangen een walvischvaarder zou niet beter zijn uitgerust wij hadden alle mogelijke instrumenten van den harpoen die met de hand geworpen wordt tot de met weerhaken voorziene pijl0.023256, en die door donderbussen en de ontplofbare kogels welke door ganzenroeren worden afgeschoten op den voorsteven stond een voortreffelijk achterlaadkanon met dikke wanden en nauwe ziel waarvan een model op de tentoonstelling van 1867 zou worden ingezonden dit prachtige stuk geschut van amerikaanschen0.071429,  oorsprong slingerde een puntkogel van vier kilogram op een gemiddelden afstand van zestien kilometer
0.034483, "houten schepen dat mogelijk maar ik heb ze nooit gezien zoolang ik niet van het tegendeel overtuigd word ontken ik dat walvisschen potvisschen eenhoorns zoo iets zouden kunnen doen"
0.090909, "o cijfers" antwoordde ned "daar doet men mede wat men wil"
0.030303, "zoo het ned en denk dan eens aan de verwoesting welke zulk een massa kan te weeg brengen als zij met de snelheid van een spoortrein tegen den romp van een schip aankomt"
0.111113, daar het ding onder den wind dwars voor ons"
0.050000, de kapitein ned land en ik stonden op dat oogenblik op de kampanje en wierpen nieuwsgierige blikken de dikke duisternis
0.018182, terwijl ik dit wonderbare verschijnsel stond te bekijken spoot het twee stralen damp en water tot op eene hoogte van 40 meter op ik maakte daaruit en uit al het andere op dat het tot de gewervelde zoogdieren behoorde tot welke familie het moest gerekend worden wist ik nog niet omdat er drie waren w0.021739, aartoe het behooren kon namelijk die der walvisschen der potvisschen en der dolfijnen waartoe ook de eenhoorns gerekend worden elk van die weder verschillende geslachten ingedeeld de geslachten soorten de soorten verschillende onderdeelen dat alles mij van dit dier nog onbekend maar ik hoopte er ac0.083334, hter te komen met de hulp des hemels en van kapitein farragut
0.032258, de equipage wachtte ongeduldig de bevelen van den kapitein af toen deze het dier nauwkeurig bekeken liet hij den machinist roepen deze kwam "mijnheer" vroeg de kapitein "hebt gij stoom genoeg"
0.019608, de machinist gehoorzaamde de manometer teekende tien atmosferen maar de visch schoot ook vooruit want zonder moeite liep hij ook 193 kilometer welke jacht neen ik ben niet staat om de ontroering te beschrijven welke mijn geheele lichaam deed trillen ned land op zijn post met de harpoen de hand vers0.142857, cheidene malen liet het dier zich naderen
0.058825, "help" het mijn laatste kreet mijn mond kwam vol water ik worstelde en zonk naar den afgrond
0.111111, "hm" zeide ned zonder zich verder uit te laten
0.020408, op dat oogenblik als om mijne bewijsvoering te bevestigen begon het water aan de achterste punt van dit zonderlinge werktuig heftig op te borrelen zoodat de beweging zeker door eene schroef moest worden voortgebracht het schip stoof vooruit wij hadden slechts den tijd om ons aan de bovenzijde welke0.058825,  ongeveer tachtig centimeter uit het water stak vast te klampen gelukkig de snelheid niet zoo buitengewoon groot
0.020000, tegen vier uur den morgen nam de snelheid toe en het moeielijk om ons bij die snelle vaart vast te houden vooral als de golven onze lichamen zweepten gelukkig ontmoette ned's hand een grooten ankerring die aan het bovenvlak vastgemaakt en waaraan wij ons stevig vastklampten eindelijk ging de lange 0.020408, nacht voorbij mijne herinnering roept mij alle indrukken niet meer voor den geest maar bijzonderheid valt mij nog als zee en wind eens voor een oogenblik zwegen meende ik verscheidene malen een vaag geluid een soort van vluchtige harmonie van verwijderde akkoorden te hooren wat dan toch het geheim 0.032258, van die onderzeesche vaart naar welker verklaring de geheele wereld te vergeefs zocht welke wezens leefden er dit zonderlinge vaartuig welk werktuig zou het met zulk eene verbazende snelheid beweging brengen
0.032258, toen deze laatste poging bepaald mislukt wisselden de beide onbekenden eenige woorden hunne onverstaanbare taal en vertrokken zonder ons zelfs met eenige geruststellende beweging te groeten de deur ging weer dicht
0.047620, "weet gij dan wel mijnheer de professor" hernam mijn lichtgeraakte metgezel "dat men die ijzeren kooi best van honger kan sterven"
0.021277, ik moest reeds sneller ademhalen om het weinigje zuurstof hetwelk de cel nog bevatte mijne longen te brengen toen ik plotseling verfrischt werd door zuivere zeelucht ik opende den mond wagewijd en mijne longen werden met versche lucht verzadigd tegelijkertijd voelde ik eene schommeling een kleine s0.026316, lingering maar welke volkomen duidelijk te herkennen het vaartuig het metalen monster naar de oppervlakte van den oceaan gerezen om er evenals de walvisschen adem te halen de wijze van luchtverversching van het vaartuig ik dus duidelijk herkend
0.058824, een zeeman kon zich daarin niet bedriegen en ik vertelde wat er gedurende hun slaap plaats gehad
0.018868, "ik veronderstel dat het toeval ons het bezit gesteld heeft van een belangrijk geheim indien dus de equipage van dit vaartuig er belang bij heeft om het te bewaren dan geloof ik dat ons leven groot gevaar loopt het tegenovergestelde geval zal het monster dat ons heeft ingeslokt ons wel weder op de 0.333333, bewoonde aarde uitspuwen"
0.021277, "tot op het oogenblik" antwoordde ned land "dat eenig fregat dat harder stoomt en behendiger dan de abraham lincoln zich van dit nest van zeeschuimers meester maakt en de equipage en ons aan het uiteinde van de groote ra voor de laatste maal een luchtje laat scheppen"
0.047619, "komaan vriend ned" vroeg koenraad "wat antwoordt gij daarop ik kan niet gelooven dat een amerikaan ooit ten einde raad is"
0.250000, "nog niet mijn vriend"
0.066667, "dat geloof ik wel" zeide koenraad "het toch beter er dan er op er onder"
0.076923, "ik vraag uw woord van eer niet meester land" antwoordde de kapitein koeltjes
0.200000, "hoe moet ik u noemen"
0.018182, "ja mijnheer de professor de zee voorziet al mijne behoeften dan eens werp ik mijne netten uit en haal ze tot scheurens toe gevuld op dan weder ga ik op de jacht dat element hetwelk voor den mensch ongenaakbaar schijnt en ik jaag het wild op dat zich mijne onderzeesche bosschen schuil houdt mijne k0.026316, udden grazen evenals die van den ouden herder van neptunes zonder eenige vrees de onmetelijke weilanden van den oceaan ik heb daar groote domeinen welke ik zelf doorzoek en waarop 's heeren hand steeds alle dingen gezaaid heeft"
0.022222, ik bedankte kapitein nemo en bekeek de bibliotheek eens wat nauwkeuriger zij telde overvloed van werken allerlei wetenschappen zoowel van zede als letterkundigen aard allerlei talen maar ik zag geen enkel werk staathuishoudkunde die schenen streng verbannen te zijn zonderling het dat al die boeken 0.037037, welke taal ook geschreven door elkander stonden en die wanorde bewees dat de kapitein van de nautilus alles vlug moest kunnen lezen wat hem de hand kwam
0.032258, "ik dank u mijnheer" zeide ik tot den kapitein "dat gij deze bibliotheek ter mijner beschikking gesteld hebt er zijn daar schatten van wetenschap verborgen waarvan ik gebruik hoop te maken"
0.038462, "rook dan naar hartelust zonder u de herkomst van deze sigaren te bekommeren geene belasting drukt ze maar daarom zijn zij geloof ik niet minder goed"
0.022727, "diezelfde instrumenten bevinden zich mijne kamer mijnheer en daar zal ik de eer hebben u er het gebruik van te verklaren bezie vooraf echter een oogenblik de hut welke voor u bestemd gij moet toch weten hoe gij op de nautilus zult gehuisvest zijn"
0.062500, "het zijn thermometrische dieplooden welke mij den warmtegraad van de verschillende diepten der zee doen kennen"
0.500000, "welke mijnheer"
0.090910, "geene mijnheer maar wat uwe ontmoeting met de abraham lincoln aangaat"
0.071429, "maar toen die stukken gereed waren moest gij die toch passen en elkander zetten"
0.500000, hoofdstuk xiv
0.028572, de kapitein drukte driemaal op een electriek klokje de pompen dreven het water uit de vergaarbakken de naald van de manometer wees door verschil drukking het stijgen van de nautilus aan tot dat alles stilstond
0.166667, "wij zijn er" zeide de kapitein
0.029412, ik behoefde hem niet aan te moedigen de brave jongen boog zich de glazen kasten en mompelde allerlei woorden en namen uit de taal der natuurkenners "weekdieren koppootigen gyproea madagascariensis" enz alles door elkander
0.020408, als men de veronderstelling van erhemberg gelooven wil dan zou er de diepten der zee een phosphoresceerend licht bestaan waardoor de natuur aan de bewoners der zee een wonderlijk schouwspel bereid heeft ik kon dit een weinig beoordeelen door het duizendvoudige spelen van het licht aan elke zijde ik0.028571,  het gezicht op deze ondoorzochte afgronden de duisternis van de zaal deed het licht buiten des te beter uitkomen en wij keken door de ramen alsof het de wanden van een zeer groot aquarium waren
0.125000, "ik heb er nooit van gehoord" antwoordde ned
0.020408, plotseling werd het weder licht de zaal de wanden werden dichtgeschoven en het betooverend gezicht verdween maar nog lang droomde ik totdat mijn blik zich op de instrumenten aan den muur vestigde het kompas wees altijd eene noordoostelijke richting aan de manometer gaf een druk aan van vijf atmosfe0.047619, ren dus eene diepte van vijftig meter en de electrieke log liet ons zien dat wij vijftien kilometer het uur maakten
0.027778, ik trachtte niet eens eenig verband te vinden tusschen den duidelijken afkeer van kapitein nemo voor eenig land en zijne uitnoodiging tot eene boschjacht en antwoordde dus "laat ons eerst eens zien wat eiland crespo is"
0.020833, "mijnheer de professor" antwoordde de kapitein "de bosschen welke ik bezit hebben licht noch warmte van de zon noodig er zijn geen leeuwen tijgers geen panters andere viervoetige dieren ik ken ze zij groeien slechts voor mij het zijn geene bosschen op het land maar onder de zee"
0.030303, "zonder twijfel doch ik heb u gezegd mijnheer aronnax dat de pompen van de nautilus de lucht onder verbazenden druk kunnen samenpersen zoodat de ijzeren vergaarbak lucht genoeg bevat voor 9 10 uur"
0.050000, "zonder twijfel hoe wilt gij dat ik bij mij aan boord kruit maak daar ik salpeter zwavel noch kool bezit"
0.040000, "met dit geweer mijnheer zijn alle schoten doodelijk zoodra een dier slechts hoe licht ook gewond valt het als van den bliksem getroffen dood neder"
0.035714, dit woud bestond uit groote boomplanten en zoodra wij er waren doorgedrongen werd mijn blik getroffen door den zonderlingen stand der takken iets wat ik nog niet opgemerkt
0.019608, na vier uur gewandeld te hebben ik verwonderd geen ergen honger te gevoelen waardoor deze zonderbare toestand van de maag ontstond zou ik niet kunnen zeggen maar daarentegen ik een onoverkomelijken lust tot slapen zooals dit met alle duikers het geval mijne oogen sloten zich weldra en ik viel een d0.035714, iepen slaap welken de beweging van het loopen kunnen beletten kapitein nemo en zijn makker strekten zich ook op den grond uit en gaven ons derhalve het voorbeeld
0.020833, gedurende een uur hadden wij eene zandvlakte voor ons er waren somwijlen hoogten die de oppervlakte der zee tot op twee meter naderden dan zag ik boven ons hoofd ons beeld zeer nauwkeurig teruggekaatst doch natuurlijk onderste boven het een troepje dat onze bewegingen en gebaren volkomen nabootste 0.071429, doch het ging met de beenen de lucht en het hoofd naar beneden voorwaarts
0.020408, gelukkig zien die vraatzuchtige dieren zeer slecht zij zwommen voorbij zonder ons te zien waarbij zij met hunne bruinachtige zwemvliezen rakelings ons heen gingen zoodat wij als door een wonder aan een gevaar ontsnapten dat zeker veel erger dan de ontmoeting met een tijger het dichtste van het woud0.333333, de stille zuidzee
0.045455, kapitein nemo zweeg en bleef verzonken de beschouwing van dat element hetwelk hij zoo goed en zoo onophoudelijk bestudeerd daarop hervatte hij
0.019608, den 26sten november ging de nautilus op lengte den kreeftskeerkring den volgenden dag kregen wij de sandwichseilanden het gezicht waar de beroemde cook 14 februari 1779 vermoord werd wij hadden toen van ons punt van uitgang af bijna 20000 kilometer afgelegd toen ik 's morgens op het plat kwam zag i0.020833, k twee kilometer onder den wind het voornaamste der zeven eilanden waaruit deze archipel bestaat ik zag duidelijk den weelderigen plantengroei langs de kust de verschillende bergketenen welke evenwijdig met het strand loopen en de vulkanen onder welke de mouna rea de hoogste daar hij 5000 meter bov0.166667, en het vlak der zee uitsteekt
0.019231, den 11den december zat ik het salon te lezen koenraad en ned land bekeken het electriek verlichte water door de ramen de nautilus lag onbeweeglijk de vergaarbakken waren vol water zoodat het schip duizend meter onder het vlak der zee lag eene diepte welke weinig bewoners telt en waar de groote viss0.090909, chen slechts hoogst zelden verschijnen plotseling stoorde koenraad mij mijne lectuur
0.031250, "het een schoone dood voor een zeeman" zeide toen kapitein nemo "het een kalm graf daar onder de koralen ik wensch dat de hemel mij en mijne makkers nimmer ander graf schenke"
0.500000, de torrestraat
0.111118, "afschuwelijk" antwoordde ik "zij niet best voor de nautilus"
0.050000, zoo peinsde ik toen de kapitein kalm en bedaard als altijd zonder eenige ontroering teleurstelling te laten blijken mij naderde
0.018868, tot mijne groote verwondering stond kapitein nemo toe wat ik hem vroeg hij deed het zelfs met de grootste beleefdheid zonder zelfs de belofte van mij te vorderen dat ik aan boord zou terug komen maar eene vlucht door nieuwguinea zeer gevaarlijk en ik zou het ned land nooit hebben aangeraden om zoo 0.041667, iets te beproeven het veel beter om aan boord van de nautilus opgesloten te zijn dan om de handen van de papoea's te vallen
0.040000, om half negen liep de sloep zacht tegen het zandige strand op na gelukkig tusschen de koraalriffen doorgekomen te zijn welke het eiland gueboroar omringden
0.018519, "het zal niet lang duren" zeide de amerikaan en met eene lens gewapend stak hij een hoop dood hout den brand dat weldra helder opflikkerde gedurende dien tijd zochten koen en ik de beste vruchten van den broodboom bijeen enkelen waren nog niet rijp genoeg en haar dikke bast omvatte een wit doch wei0.021739, nig vezelig merg anderen waren geel en geleiachtig en wachtten slechts het oogenblik om geplukt te worden die vruchten zat geen kern koenraad bracht er een twaalftal aan ned die ze op een kolenvuur legde nadat hij ze schijfjes gesneden terwijl hij dit deed zeide hij
0.027027, "welnu komaan mijnheer" riep ned land uit "gij spreekt als een natuuronderzoeker en ik zal handelen als een bakker koen haal eens een hoop vruchten op die wij mede kunnen nemen als wij weer naar boord gaan"
0.037037, "al die planten en vruchten maken geen maal uit" antwoordde ned "hiermede eindigt een maaltijd dat het dessert maar de soep en het gebraad waar zijn die"
0.111111, "omdat die vogel zoo dronken als een snip is"
0.047619, op dat oogenblik viel er een steen voor onze voeten neder en maakte een einde aan de voorstellen van het tweetal
0.333333, "kapitein" zeide ik
0.090909, "te drommel het hagelt" riep koenraad "misschien het wel vergiftigde hagel"
0.018868, wij liepen recht naar het westen en den 11den januari voeren wij om kaap wessel die op ol en nb de westpunt van de golf van carpentaria vormt er waren nog tal van klippen doch zij lagen verder uit elkander en waren op de kaart met buitengewone nauwkeurigheid aangeteekend de nautilus vermeed gemakke0.052632, lijk de branding van money aan bakboord en de klippen victoria aan stuurboord en bleef den tienden parallel volgen
0.333333, "ik luister kapitein"
0.020408, de kapitein bracht mij naar het achterschip eene hut dicht bij het matrozenverblijf daar lag een veertigjarig man met een krachtig gelaat dat zijne angelsaksische afkomst verried ik boog mij hem heen het geene zieke maar een gewonde zijn hoofd met bloedige zwachtels omwonden en rustte op een kussen0.047619,  ik maakte het verband los de gewonde opende zijne groote glazige oogen en liet mij begaan zonder eenig geluid te geven
0.032259, de kapitein sprak eenige woorden tot zijn stuurman die daarop aanstonds wegging weldra dook de nautilus weer onder water en de manometer wees aan dat zij op tien meter diepte voer
0.034483, wat ned land aangaat ik beken dat ik mij niet zoo geheel van zijn voorzichtigheid verzekerd hield een gevaar hoe groot ook voor zijn strijdlustig karakter altijd eenige aantrekkingskracht
0.045455, "welnu gaat dan zitten vrienden en ik zal u alles meedeelen wat het boek van sirr er mij zelf van geleerd heeft"
0.066667, "afschuwelijk vriend ned" antwoordde koenraad "maar een klein glaasje azijn dat kost nog al aardig"
0.333333, "kom" zei koenraad
0.066667, "maar" vroeg koenraad die altijd meer van die dingen wilde weten "is die parelvisscherij gevaarlijk"
0.500000, hoofdstuk xxvii
0.166667, "moeten wij onze scaphanders niet aantrekken"
0.028571, de kapitein mijn beide makkers en ik gingen achter de boot zitten een stuurman zat aan het roer en de matrozen hielden de riemen gereed de boot werd afgestooten en wij waren het ruime sop
0.018519, de kapitein kende zeker het bestaan van dit schelpdier het de eerste maal niet dat hij het zag en ik geloof dat hij er ons heen geleidde om ons die bijzonderheid der natuur te doen bewonderen ik bedroog mij echter want de kapitein er bijzonder belang bij zich van den tegenwoordigen toestand van de 0.333333, oester te vergewissen
0.029412, ons bezoek aan dit kostbaar voorwerp de kapitein verliet de grot en wij beklommen de oesterbank weer te midden van het heldere water dat door het werk der duikers nog niet troebel werd gemaakt
0.017857, ik keek met verwilderd oog ik zag den strijd van vorm veranderen de kapitein werd door het groote gewicht dat op hem drukte tegen den grond geworpen toen openden zich de kaken van het dier op huiveringwekkende wijze en het zou met den kapitein gedaan geweest zijn als ned land niet zoo snel als de g0.021277, edachte den haai met de punt van zijn vreeselijken harpoen getroffen het water werd geheel door bloed gekleurd en door den haai met onbeschrijfelijke woede beweging gebracht ned land zijn doel niet gemist het waren de laatste stuiptrekkingen van het monster dat het hart getroffen zulke vreeselijke 0.090909, bewegingen maakte dat koenraad er door tegen den grond werd geworpen
0.018519, wij volgden hem alle drie en eenige oogenblikken daarna kwamen wij wonderbaarlijk gered bij de boot van den visscher de tweede zorg van den kapitein om den ongelukkige weer het leven te roepen ik wist niet hij daarin slagen zou ik hoopte het wel want de arme duivel niet lang onder water gelegen maa0.076924, r de slag met den staart van het monster kon hem gedood hebben
0.022727, "ik veronderstel dat de nautilus na de merkwaardige zee tusschen en egypte bezocht te hebben naar den indischen oceaan terug zal keeren hetzij door het kanaal van mozambique hetzij langs de maskarenen om zich van daar naar de kaap de goede hoop te richten"
0.019608, ik meende wel dat kapitein nemo nu zou terugkeeren doch ik bedroog mij en tot mijn groote verbazing deed hij dit niet den 7den februari kwamen wij de straat van babelmandeb dat het arabisch beteekent "tranenpoort" zij twintig kilometer breed en twee en vijftig lang de nautilus liep met volle vaart 0.020000, minder dan een uur er door doch ik zag niets zelfs niet het eiland perim dat de engelsche regeering heeft doen bezetten om daardoor de stelling van aden te versterken er kwamen voortdurend te veel stoombooten der engelsche fransche maildiensten door deze nauwe zeestraat dan dat de nautilus er zich 0.062502, kon vertoonen daarom bleef zij wijselijk onder water eindelijk waren wij des middags de roode zee
0.022727, deze poliepaardige plantdieren zaten aan rotsen aan schulpen van weekdieren en zelfs aan de waterplanten zij vulden zelfs de kleinste spleten sommigen spreidden zich uit anderen richtten zich overeind hingen als koraalvormige uitwassen nederwaarts ik vertelde aan koenraad dat die sponsen op wijze g0.029413, evischt worden met een dreg met de hand deze laatste handelwijze waarvoor duikers noodig zijn de verkieslijkste want als men het weefsel weet te sparen zijn de sponsen er des te meer om waard
0.035714, "zeker" antwoordde ik "gij zijt met uw vaartuig een eeuw vooruit misschien wel meer dan hoe ongelukkig dat zulk een uitvinding met den uitvinder moet te gronde gaan"
0.125000, "ja" antwoordde ik "maar hun vrees niet overdreven"
0.026316, "och mijnheer 'zij hebben ooren en hooren niet' zal ten allen tijde waar blijven niet alleen bestaat die doorgang doch ik ben er verscheiden malen doorgegaan zonder dat zou ik mij nu niet de roode zee gewaagd hebben"
0.100000, "ja mijn jongen" antwoordde ik "soms ontmoet men ze nog"
0.047619, "laten wij maar wachten" merkte koenraad op "de nautilus gaat dien kant uit en spoedig zullen wij zien wat het is"
0.500000, "zeker mijnheer"
0.038462, "en zoudt gij gaarne voor dag uw ambacht van visscher weer opvatten om dit dier bij de lijst te voegen van die gij reeds getroffen hebt"
0.142857, "gaat gij niet mee kapitein" vroeg ik
0.018868, de sloep stak af en door zes riemen voortgestuwd naderde zij snel den dugong die op dat oogenblik ongeveer twee kilometer van den nautilus af op eenige kabellengten van het dier gekomen roeiden wij langzamer en de riemen werden zoo stil mogelijk door het kalme water bewogen ned land ging met zijn h0.018519, arpoen de hand op de voorplecht der sloep staan gewoonlijk zulk een harpoen bevestigd aan een lang touw dat snel afgewonden wordt als het gewonde dier met een harpoen het lichaam vlucht maar thans die lijn niet langer dan tien vadem doch aan het einde zat een klein vaatje vast dat drijvende de plaa0.100004, ts moest aanwijzen waar de dugong zich onder water bevond
0.020000, ik opgestaan en bekeek onzen vijand nauwkeurig deze dugong geleek veel op een zeekoe het lange lichaam eindigde een zeer langen staart en de zijvinnen hadden wezenlijke vingers aan de toppen het onderscheid tusschen dit dier en de zeekoe bestond daarin dat het de bovenkaak twee lange en puntige tan0.023810, den welke aan elke zijde een naar buiten staand verdedigingswapen vormden de dugong bijzonder groot want hij niet minder dan zeven meter lang hij bewoog zich niet en scheen op het water te slapen een omstandigheid die de vangst veel gemakkelijker maakte
0.250000, "let op" riep hij
0.028571, electrische draden verbonden den stuurstoel met de machinekamer en van daar kon de kapitein aan zijn nautilus dus zoowel richting als beweging geven hij drukte op een metalen knop en aanstonds werd de snelheid verminderd
0.071429, "welnu ned nu luisteren wij naar u" zei ik "wat hebt gij te vertellen"
0.034483, "welnu mijnheer" zei ned land "omdat koenraad dus niet bestaat kunnen wij met ons beiden de zaak afhandelen ik heb gesproken u hebt geluisterd wat hebt u te antwoorden"
0.023256, "dat alles heel juist" antwoordde de amerikaan "maar uw opmerking toepasselijk op elke poging om te ontvluchten hetzij die plaats hebbe twee jaar twee dagen derhalve blijft altijd de vraag deze als een gunstige gelegenheid zich voordoet moet men er van gebruik maken"
0.111111, "zonder twijfel wij varen een stroom van kokend water"
0.200000, "over hoeveel eeuwen" vroeg koenraad
0.034483, "dat zijn nu geleerden" zei de kapitein lachend "en zij weten niets kom ga zitten" voegde hij er bij "ik zal u een merkwaardig voorval uit die historie meedeelen"
0.028572, "mijnheer de professor" zei hij "luister goed naar mij deze geschiedenis zal u om zekere reden belang inboezemen want zij zal antwoord geven op een vraag die gij tot nog toe niet hebt kunnen oplossen"
0.066667, "wel zeker" zei ik nog niet wetende waarom hij mij die les de geschiedenis gaf
0.020000, "ik ga dus voort ziehier wat er gebeurde de kooplieden van cadix hadden een voorrecht volgens hetwelk zij al de uit oostindie komende koopwaren mochten ontvangen het lossen dus van die schatten de baai van vigo tegen hun voorrechten zij beklaagden zich te madrid en verkregen van den zwakken philips0.020408,  v dat het konvooi zonder gelost te worden op de reede van vigo zou blijven liggen totdat de vijandelijke vloten zich zouden verwijderd hebben terwijl men deze beslissing nam kwamen de engelsche schepen october 1702 de baai van vigo aan de admiraal de verdedigde zich dapper niettegenstaande zijn mi0.033333, nderheid maar toen hij zag dat de schatten van het konvooi den vijand handen zouden vallen stak hij de galjoenen brand zoodat zij met hunne onmetelijke rijkdommen zee verzwolgen werden"
0.018182, "zonder twijfel doch om het er uit te halen zou meer kosten dan het waard hier integendeel behoef ik maar op te rapen wat de menschen verloren hebben en niet alleen de baai van vigo maar op duizend andere plaatsen van schipbreuken die ik allen op mijn kaarten heb aangeteekend begrijpt gij nu dat ik0.250000,  meer dan millionnair ben"
0.018519, "ik geloof dat graag" zei ik "een goede raad aan die aandeelhouders zou dan ook een daad van welwillendheid zijn wie weet echter men dien raad wel zou aannemen want wat spelers vooral betreuren niet zoozeer het verlies van hun geld als wel dat van hun dwaze verwachtingen ik beklaag ze dan ook minde0.038462, r dan die duizenden ongelukkigen voor wie deze rijkdommen bij een verstandige verdeeling van groot nut zouden geweest zijn terwijl ze nu nutteloos voor hen blijven"
0.050000, "of liever zijn bank ik versta daardoor dezen oceaan waar schatten beter veiligheid zijn dan de schatkist van den staat"
0.018868, toen vertelde ik ned wat er den vorigen dag gebeurd met de stille hoop van hem van het denkbeeld af te brengen om te vluchten maar mijn verhaal geen ander gevolg dan dat ned land zijn spijt uitdrukte voor eigen rekening ook niet eens een wandeling de baai van vigo te kunnen doen
0.125000, "welke de richting van den nautilus" vroeg ik
0.066667, "wat gij mij daar zegt kapitein verdubbelt mijn nieuwsgierigheid ik ben gereed u te volgen"
0.019608, welk een schouwspel hoe het terug te geven hoe het gezicht te beschrijven van die bosschen en rotsen te midden van het water van onder vrees aanjagende en sombere duisternis gehuld en wier toppen van rosachtig licht omringd waren voortkomend uit die onbekende bron van gloed waarvan de schijn door d0.022222, e terugkaatsing van het water verdubbelde wij beklommen rotsen waarvan onder dof geluid brokken afgescheurd werden en naar beneden stortten rechts en links waren donkere galerijen waarin zich het oog verloor daar waren groote groeven door een menschenhand schijnbaar gegraven en ik vroeg mij zelven 0.071429, af ik niet plotseling een bewoner dier onderzeesche streken voor mij zou zien verschijnen
0.027027, ik gevoel wel dat ik onwaarheid schijn te vertellen nu ik dezen onderzeeschen tocht beschrijf doch ik schrijf de geschiedenis van schijnbaar onmogelijke zaken die echter onbetwistbaar waar zijn ik heb niet gedroomd maar gezien en getast
0.020833, waar ik ik wilde het weten ik wilde spreken en den koperen helm mij van 't hoofd rukken maar de kapitein kwam naar mij toe en hield mij met beweging tegen toen raapte hij een stuk krijtsteen op liep naar een zwarte basaltrots en schreef daarop het woord
0.019231, tegen vier uur des namiddags veranderde de grond een weinig tot nog toe hij met een dikke laag slijk en met tot erts geworden takken bedekt nu werd de bodem rotsachtiger en scheen bezaaid met tufsteen eenige brokken lava en zwavelachtige bestanddeelen ik dacht dat de bergstreek dus weldra op de gro0.018182, ote vlakten zou volgen en door zekere wendingen van den nautilus zag ik ook inderdaad dat de zuidelijke gezichteinder door een hoogen muur begrensd die elken uitgang scheen af te snijden de top van dien berg stak zeker boven de zee uit het moest een vast land zijn ten minste een eiland hetzij een d0.020000, er canarische hetzij een der kaapverdische daar men misschien om bijzondere redenen de zonshoogte niet genomen wist ik niet juist waar wij ons bevonden allen gevalle scheen het mij toe dat die bergmuur de grens van atlantis vormde van welk land wij evenwel nog slechts een klein gedeelte bezocht had0.019608, ik betrad het plat en wachtte de duisternis zoo volkomen dat ik den kapitein zelfs niet zag naar boven kijkend meende ik recht boven mijn hoofd een zekeren lichtenden schijn te zien een soort van schemering door een rond gat binnenvallend op dat oogenblik werd de lantaarn ontstoken het helder licht0.166667,  deed het zwakke schijnsel geheel verdwijnen
0.052632, "ja de krater die vroeger lavavlammen en rook uitwierp en waar nu de frissche lucht die wij inademen binnenstroomt"
0.019231, wij lagen ongeveer een uur de schoone grot uitgestrekt toen ons gesprek dat den beginne vrij levendig geweest begon te verflauwen zekere slaperigheid overviel ons en daar ik geen enkele reden zag om dit tegen te gaan dommelde ik zachtjes ik droomde en wie meester om zijn droomen te kiezen ik droomd0.035714, e dat mijn geheele bestaan zich dat van een weekdier oploste het scheen mij alsof de grot mijn schelp plotseling werd ik door het schreeuwen van koenraad gewekt
0.022727, ik zag ook zeldzame exemplaren van de klasse der stekelvinnigen en der zaagvisschen sommige schrijvers trouwens meer dichters dan natuurkenners beweren dat deze visschen liefelijk zingen en een vereeniging van hun stemmen een muziek voortbrengt waarbij de menschelijke stem niet kan halen ik ontken 0.018868, het niet maar die dieren gaven ons tot ons groot leedwezen geen enkele serenade eindelijk zagen wij nog een groote menigte vliegende visschen niets aardiger dan te zien hoe de dolfijnen ze met groote juistheid wisten na te jagen hoe hoog zij zich ook uit zee konden verheffen welken boog zij ook bes0.045455, chreven tot zelfs den nautilus heen de ongelukkige visschen vonden den bek van den dolfijn altijd geopend om ze op te vangen
0.250000, "juist" zei de kapitein
0.333333, potvisschen en walvisschen
0.021277, de walvisch heeft altijd een groote rol gespeeld op het gebied der scheepvaart en ontzaglijk grooten invloed uitgeoefend op de aardrijkskundige ontdekkingen die visch heeft eerst de basken later engelschen en hollanders aangelokt hen tegen alle gevaren der zee gehard gemaakt en hen van het eene uit0.020408, erste der aarde naar het andere gevoerd de walvisschen leven het liefst de noordelijke en zuidelijke oude legenden zeggen zelfs dat deze dieren de visschers tot op 28 kilometer van de noordpool hebben gevoerd als het feit onwaar zal het toch eens waar worden en vermoedelijk zullen de walvischvaarde0.055556, rs bij het vervolgen van die dieren de eenmaal de tot nog toe onbekende punten der aarde bereiken
0.200000, "zooals ik u zei ned"
0.250001, "omdat men het zegt"
0.062500, "waarvoor zou dat dienen" antwoordde de kapitein jagen om te vernielen wij hebben geen walvischtraan noodig"
0.500000, de ijsbank
0.020409, de nautilus zijn vaart naar het zuiden ongestoord weer voortgezet het schip volgde den vijftigsten meridiaan met verbazende snelheid wilde de kapitein de pool dan bereiken ik dacht het niet want tot nog toe hadden alle plannen om tot dit punt van den aardbol te geraken schipbreuk geleden bovendien 0.058824, het jaargetijde reeds vrij ver gevorderd daar 13 maart het zuiden met 13 september het noorden overeenkomt
0.020000, bij deze vaart tusschen de ijsbergen kapitein nemo dikwijls op het plat hij beschouwde deze eenzame stilte met de grootste oplettendheid ik zag zijn kalm gelaat zich soms verlevendigen zeide hij mogelijk bij zich zelven dat hij die waar niemand kon doordringen zich te huis gevoelde en hij alleen de0.021277,  ondoordringbare ruimte beheerschte misschien wel doch hij sprak niet hij stond onbeweeglijk en scheen nu en dan slechts tot zich zelven te komen als hij zijn schip moest besturen hij richtte zijn nautilus met volmaakte bekwaamheid en vermeed behendig den schok met de ijsgevaarten van welke sommige0.021277,  verscheiden kilometer lang en zeventig tachtig meter hoog waren soms scheen het alsof de gezichteinder geheel gesloten op zb bijna alle ruimte om te varen verdwenen maar de kapitein zocht nauwkeurig en vond weldra weer een kleine opening waardoor hij stoutmoedig heengleed echter wetende dat zij zi0.166667, ch onmiddellijk achter hem zou sluiten
0.025000, den 16den maart tegen acht uur 's morgens voer de nautilus op den vijfentwintigsten meridiaan den zuiderpoolcirkel het ijs omringde ons van alle kanten en sloot den gezichteinder evenwel stuurde kapitein nemo van spleet tot spleet en voer immer verder
0.019231, als de nautilus soms onder water voer wanneer zulke kolossen elkander stortten dan plantte zich het gedruisch onder water met een vreeselijke kracht voort en de val van die gevaarten bracht dan de zee tot zelfs op groote diepte heftige beweging de nautilus slingerde dan als een schip dat aan de woe0.250000, de der elementen blootgesteld
0.200000, "de ijsbank" zei de amerikaan
0.250000, "dan hij een baas"
0.142857, "ja mijnheer wij gaan naar de zuidpool"
0.066667, "naar de pool" riep ik uit terwijl ik een teeken van ongeloof niet kon onderdrukken
0.020408, ja ik wist het ik wist dat die man stoutmoedig tot roekeloosheid toe maar om de hinderpalen te overwinnen die het bereiken van de zuidpool beletten die vrij wat ongenaakbaarder dan de noordpool tot welke koene reizigers nog niet eens hebben kunnen doordringen scheen mij een onzinnige onderneming we0.038462, lke alleen het brein van een krankzinnige kon opkomen ik vroeg den kapitein hij die pool reeds ontdekt waar geen sterveling nog ooit den voet zette
0.018519, "bovendien kapitein" zei ik mij opwindend "waarom zou er niet even goed aan de zuid als aan de noordpool een open zee zijn geen van beide halfronden valt de pool der aarde samen met die der strengste koude en men moet totdat het tegendeel bewezen veronderstellen dat er op die beide punten een vaste0.199999, land een open zee bestaat"
0.032258, een "zooals mijnheer goedvindt" zijn antwoord op deze mededeeling en daarmee kon ik mij tevreden stellen wat ned land aangaat deze trok den schouder zoo hoog op als ooit iemand gedaan
0.017544, mijn hart klopte hevig zouden wij boven komen en aan de pool de vrije lucht inademen neen een schok verkondigde mij dat de nautilus onder tegen de ijsbank gestooten en dat deze blijkens het doffe geluid van den slag nog zeer dik wij lagen nog op 330 meter diepte zoodat er een dikte van 440 meter ij0.062500, s boven ons hoofd lag de ijsbank dus hier hooger dan het begin dit weinig geruststellend
0.019231, wij hadden twee uur noodig om den top dezer rots van porfier en basalt te bereiken van daar strekte onze blik zich uit een zee die aan den noordelijken gezichteinder duidelijk van de lucht afgescheiden voor onze voeten strekte zich een schitterend witte vlakte uit boven ons hoofd welfde zich een li0.021277, chtblauwe hemel zonder eenigen nevel het noorden vertoonde zich de zonneschijf als een vurige bol waarvan de gezichteinder aan de onderzijde een stuk scheen te hebben afgesneden uit de zee werden prachtige waterstralen als fonteinen door de walvisschen opgespoten de verte lag de nautilus als een sl0.028572, apende walvisch op het water achter ons het zuiden en oosten strekte zich een verbazend groot land uit dat met een ontzaglijke menigte rotsblokken en ijsschotsen bedekt en waarvan men het einde niet kon bespeuren
0.020000, de thermometer stond op twaalf graden onder nul en als de wind wat aanwakkerde sneed deze ons het gezicht bijna stuk de zee scheen overal te zullen dichtvriezen tallooze zwarte plekken toonden reeds de vorming van het jonge ijs de zee zou dus gedurende de zes wintermaanden waarschijnlijk geheel ont0.020000, oegankelijk zijn waar bleven de walvisschen dien tijd zonder twijfel zochten zij onder de ijsbank door een open zee de zeekalven en walrussen die beter tegen het ruwe klimaat konden bleven deze bevroren streken deze dieren graven door instinct gedreven gaten het ijs en weten die open te houden door0.041667,  die gaten kunnen zij ademhalen en als dan de vogels ook voor de koude vluchten dan zijn deze dieren de eenige bewoners dezer poolstreken
0.083334, "maar wij zijn ten minste aan de oppervlakte der zee" vroeg ik
0.062500, ned gelijk het al te prachtig plotseling keerde ik mij om op een kreet van koenraad
0.250000, "zeer belangwekkend" antwoordde ik
0.021740, "de eerste manier" vervolgde hij "is om te sterven door verplettering de tweede door verstikking ik spreek niet van de mogelijkheid om den hongerdood te sterven want de proviand van den nautilus zal langer duren dan wij laten wij dus alleen de beide eerste gevallen spreken"
0.200000, "aan welken kant" vroeg ik
0.018868, "ik weet het" antwoordde hij op dien kalmen toon die de vreeselijkste omstandigheden niet konden doen veranderen "het een gevaar te meer maar ik zie geen middel om het te verhoeden onze eenige kans op behoud sneller te werken dan de vorst het er om te doen de eersten te zijn dat alles"
0.058825, "mijnheer aronnax" zei hij "wij moeten iets groots wagen wij zullen dit water evenals cement worden vastgemetseld"
0.090909, de kapitein keek mij aan en zei "overmorgen zijn zij leeg"
0.071429, "wij zullen slagen" zei ik tot den kapitein nadat ik herhaaldelijk den thermometer waargenomen
0.019231, hoe ik op het plat kwam weet ik niet misschien de amerikaan mij er heen gebracht doch ik haalde weer adem de zuivere zeelucht drong mijn longen door mijn twee makkers ademden evenals ik de versche lucht met volle teugen ongelukkigen die te lang honger hebben geleden kunnen zich niet straffeloos op 0.038462, de hun voorgezette spijzen werpen wij daarentegen behoefden ons niet te houden wij konden volop genieten en het een zachte zeewind die ons dit genot toevoerde
0.040000, "o" riep koenraad "wat dat heerlijk wat die zuurstof goed mijnheer behoeft niet bang te zijn om adem te halen er genoeg voor ons allen"
0.100000, "vooral als wij van hem af zijn" zei ned land
0.018868, toen de hoogste bergtoppen der malouinen aan den gezichteinder verdwenen waren liet de nautilus zich tot op een diepte van twintig meter zinken en volgde nu de amerikaansche kust kapitein nemo vertoonde zich het geheel niet wij bleven op de hoogte van tot den 3den april dan eens op dan eens onder h0.018868, et zeevlak de nautilus dreef voorbij de groote golf welke door de monding van den rio la plata gevormd wordt en 4 april op de hoogte der kust van uraguay maar bleef er omstreeks vijftig kilometer van af hij voer altijd nog noordwaarts en volgde de lange bochten der zuidafrikaansche kust wij hadden 0.083333, sedert ons vertrek uit de wateren van japan ongeveer 64000 kilometer afgelegd
0.019231, wij gingen onder den evenaar door twintig kilometer westwaarts van ons hadden wij guyana waar wij bij onze vlucht zeker een goede ontvangst zouden genoten hebben maar de wind stak hevig op en de woede der golven zou ons met een sloep aan groote gevaren hebben blootgesteld ned land begreep dit zonde0.030304, r twijfel en sprak nergens van ik maakte ook van mijn kant geen enkele toespeling op zijn ontvluchtingsplannen want ik wilde hem tot geen poging aanmoedigen waarbij hij zeker schipbreuk zou geleden hebben
0.019231, den 16den april hadden wij martinique en guadeloupe op omstreeks dertig kilometer afstand het gezicht een oogenblik zag ik de hoogste bergtoppen ned land die er op rekende de golf van mexico zijn plan ten uitvoer te brengen door naar het land te vluchten een der talrijke booten te bereiken die den 0.027778, dienst tusschen de verschillende eilanden doen zeer teleurgesteld de vlucht zeker mogelijk geweest als ned land zich buiten weten van den kapitein van de sloep kunnen meester maken maar midden den oceaan daar geen denken aan
0.026316, welke verandering er met hem plaatsgehad waarom ik mij niets te verwijten hinderde hem misschien onze tegenwoordigheid echter behoefde ik er niet op te rekenen dat hij de man er naar om ons de vrijheid terug te geven
0.250000, "met mijn eigen oogen"
0.166667, "in de haven" vroeg ned spottend
0.500000, "inderdaad koenraad"
0.200000, "wat zult gij dan doen"
0.020833, welk een tooneel de ongelukkige door een voelarm gegrepen en door de zuignappen vastgehouden werd door deze vreeselijke slang heen en weer geslingerd hij steunde stikte en riep "help help" deze het fransch gesproken woorden deden mij verstomd staan ik dus misschien wel meer landgenooten aan boord d0.090909, ie hartverscheurende kreet zal mij mijn leven lang de ooren klinken
0.020408, te midden van die worsteling de wanhoopskreet door den ongelukkige geuit mij het hart verscheurd de arme franschman zijn vreemdsoortige taal op dit oogenblik vergeten om zijn moedertaal een laatsten kreet te slaken ik dus een landgenoot onder de bemanning van den nautilus die met lichaam en ziel aa0.023256, n kapitein nemo gehecht en evenals hij den omgang met de menschen ontvluchtte hij de eenige franschman die vreemdsoortige vereeniging die duidelijk uit menschen van verschillenden landaard samengesteld dit nog een van die onoplosbare raadsels welke mij zonder ophouden voor den geest kwamen
0.019231, kapitein nemo ging weer naar zijn kamer en gedurende eenige dagen zag ik hem niet naar het vaartuig te oordeelen waarvan hij de ziel en dat al zijn indrukken ondervond moest hij treurig wanhopig zelfs en besluiteloos zijn de nautilus voer niet meer bepaalde richting het schip kwam en ging liet zich0.022727,  als een dood lichaam door de golven voortwiegen de schroef weer vrij en toch bediende het er zich ter nauwernood van de kapitein voer onzeker hij kon de plek van den pas geleverden strijd niet verlaten de zee die een van de zijnen verzwolgen
0.090909, "welnu mijnheer" hernam ned toen hij zag dat ik niet antwoordde
0.019608, de bodem der zee geleek dan ook veel op een slagveld waar al de overwonnenen waren gezonken sommige schepen reeds oud en met zeeplanten begroeid andere nog nieuw zoodat de lichtstralen van onze lantaarn op het ijzer en koperwerk weerkaatsten hoeveel schepen waren daar niet onder die met man en muis0.022223,  met een scheepslading landverhuizers waren vergaan omdat zij op die gevaarlijke plaatsen op riffen en banken hadden gestooten want sedert verscheiden jaren waren er heel wat slachtoffers gevoegd bij al hetgeen de zee reeds verzwolgen de koninklijke mail de inmann en montreallijnen hadden daartoe t0.020833, al van booten geleverd de solway de isis de paramata de hungarian de canadian de anglosaxon de humboldt de unitedstates die alle gestooten hadden de arctic de lyonnais die door aanzeiling vergaan de president de pacific de cityofglasgow die door onbekende oorzaken verdwenen waren dit waren alle som0.071429, bere wrakken tusschen welke de nautilus doorvoer alsof zij tusschen een rij dooden doorging
0.125000, "ik zal eens goed raden" zei koenraad "500000"
0.090909, "elf millioen dat geloof ik niet ik moet ze zelf tellen"
0.090909, "goed" antwoordde koenraad "ik geloof mijnheer ik zal ze niet natellen"
0.020408, de eerste kabel werd 1857 en 1858 vervaardigd en gelegd doch nadat men ongeveer 400 telegrammen overgeseind hield hij op te werken 1883 vervaardigden de ingenieurs een nieuwen kabel van 3400 kilometer lengte en 4500 ton zwaarte en scheepten dien op de greateastern den 25sten mei bevond de nautilus 0.019231, zich op een diepte van 3836 meter juist op de plaats waar deze draad gebroken waardoor de onderneming duigen viel het op 638 kilometer van de iersche kust men bemerkte 's middags te twee uur dat de gemeenschap met europa afgebroken de telegrafisten aan boord besloten den kabel af te hakken voordat 0.020833, men dien opvischte en om elf uur 's avonds hadden zij het beschadigde gedeelte weer binnen boord geheschen men herstelde de breuk en de kabel werd opnieuw zee gelaten maar eenige dagen later brak hij weer en kon uit de diepte van den oceaan niet weer worden opgevischt
0.045455, "mijnheer" zei ned land "als dit schip ons op kilometer afstands voorbijkomt spring ik zee en noodig u uit hetzelfde te doen"
0.024390, ik antwoordde niets op het voorstel van den amerikaan en ik ging voort met het schip te bekijken dat zichtbaar grooter werd het een engelschman franschman amerikaan rus het zeker dat het ons goed zou opnemen als wij het konden bereiken
0.045455, "ellendeling" riep de kapitein "wil je dan dat ik je op de spoor van den nautilus vastspijker voordat ik dat schip aangrijp"
0.026316, "ik weet het niet maar waar het ook vandaan zij middernacht het den grond geboord allen gevalle het beter met dit schip te zinken dan deelgenooten te zijn van een wraak waarvan wij de billijkheid niet kunnen beoordeelen"
0.017857, ik bleef tot zes uur 's morgens op het plat zonder dat de kapitein mij scheen gezien te hebben het schip hield op anderhalven kilometer achter ons en met het krieken van den dag opende het opnieuw zijn kanonvuur het oogenblik kon niet ver meer af zijn dat de nautilus zijn vijand zou aanvallen en mi0.019231, jn makkers en ik den man dien ik niet durfde beoordeelen voor altijd zouden verlaten ik wilde naar beneden gaan om hen te waarschuwen toen de stuurman op het plat kwam verscheiden matrozen kwamen mee kapitein nemo zag hen niet wilde ze niet zien er werden eenige toebereidselen voor het gevecht gema0.020833, akt deze waren zeer eenvoudig de leuning om het plat werd neergeslagen eveneens werden de lantaarn en het uitstek van den stuurstoel naar binnengeschoven zoodat zij niet boven het buitenkleedsel van den nautilus uitstaken op de oppervlakte van den langen ijzeren cylinder stak niets meer uit wat de 0.019231, beweging kon hinderen ik ging weer naar den salon de nautilus dreef altijd boven het zeewater werd door de morgenschemering reeds eenigszins verlicht bij de deining der golven werden de ramen van den salon van tijd tot tijd rood gekleurd door de stralen der opkomende zon de vreeselijke dag van 2 ju0.023810, ni brak aan om vijf uur wees de log dat de nautilus zijn snelheid verminderde ik begreep dat hij het stoomschip liet naderen daarenboven konden wij de kanonschoten duidelijker hooren de kogels vielen het water en drongen daar met zonderling gesis door
0.083334, "vrienden" zei ik "het oogenblik gekomen een handdruk en god helpe ons"
0.083333, ned land vastberaden koenraad kalm ik zenuwachtig ik kon mij ternauwernood inhouden
0.125000, ik stond op "wanneer vluchten wij" vroeg ik
0.200000, "ja maar waar zijn wij"
0.066667, "ik weet het niet maar wat het ook zijn moge wij zullen er heen vluchten"
0.017241, ik kwam weer den salon waar ik tegelijk vreesde en toch verlangde om den kapitein te ontmoeten ik wilde hem nog wel eens zien en dan weer wilde ik dit niet wat zou ik hem gezegd hebben kon ik het onwillekeurig afgrijzen verbergen dat hij mij inboezemde neen het beter dat ik hem niet meer zag het be0.166667, ter hem te vergeten en toch
