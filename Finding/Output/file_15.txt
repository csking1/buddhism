0.017544, "ik heb lang geaarzeld" vervolgde de gezagvoerder "niets noodzaakte mij om u gastvrijheid te verleenen als ik mij van u wilde ontdoen ik geen enkel belang om u te houden ik u dan weer op het plat gezet dat u reeds eens tot schuilplaats diende ik zou het vaartuig zee hebben doen zinken en ik zou ver0.090909, geten hebben dat gij ooit bestaan hadt ik daartoe geen recht"
0.052632, "wat moeten wij dan het denkbeeld laten varen om ooit ons vaderland onze vrienden en bloedverwanten terug te zien"
0.017857, "laat ik nu verder gaan met hetgeen ik u te zeggen ik ken u mijnheer aronnax gij zult u wellicht niet zoozeer als uwe makkers te beklagen hebben het toeval dat u tot mij heeft gebracht gij zult onder de boeken welke voor mijne lievelingsstudie dienen het werk vinden hetwelk gij de diepten der zee h0.018182, ebt uitgegeven ik heb het dikwijls gelezen gij hebt dat werk alles medegedeeld wat de aardsche wetenschap kent maar gij weet niet alles gij hebt niet alles gezien ik zeg u mijnheer de professor dat gij u den tijd niet zult beklagen welken gij bij mij aan boord doorbrengt gij zult eene reis door een0.021277, e wereld van wonderen doen gij zult waarschijnlijk voortdurend verwonderd ja zelfs verstomd staan vermoedelijk zult gij niet spoedig genoeg hebben van het schouwspel hetwelk u voortdurend wordt aangeboden ik ga op eene nieuwe onderzeesche reis om de aarde welke misschien de laatste zal zijn al datg0.018868, ene nog eens weder beschouwen wat ik die zoo dikwijls bezochte diepten bestudeerd heb en gij zult daarin mijn deelgenoot zijn van heden af betreedt gij eene nieuwe wereld gij zult zien wat geen mensch nog gezien heeft want ik en mijne equipage behooren niet meer tot de menschen en onze planeet zal 0.125000, u door mij hare innigste geheimen laten zien"
0.076923, "neem plaats mijnheer en eet als iemand die van den honger sterven moet"
0.025001, gij beschouwt die schelpen mijnheer de professor zij mogen een natuurkenner belang inboezemen maar zij hebben voor mij een aangenamer zijde want ik heb ze allen eigenhandig verzameld en er geene zee op den aardbol welke ik niet onderzocht heb"
0.333333, "en welk dat"
0.100000, "hoe hebt gij dan eene sloep" vroeg ik vrij verwonderd
0.030303, een vierde waterdicht beschot scheidde deze ruimte van de machinekamer een deur opende zich en ik bevond mij de ruimte waar kapitein nemo zeker een uitstekend ingenieur zijne toestellen voor de beweegkracht geplaatst
0.076923, ik beschouwde met eene licht te begrijpen belangstelling de machines van de nautilus
0.020408, "gij ziet" zeide kapitein nemo "dat ik de elementen van bunsen en niet die van ruhmkorff gebruik de laatsten zouden niet sterk genoeg geweest zijn de bunsensche elementen zijn slechts weinig getal maar sterk en groot hetwelk de ondervinding mij geleerd heeft dat beter de electrieke stroom wordt naa0.025000, r achteren gevoerd waar hij door electromagneten van groote afmeting inwerkt op een bijzonder stelsel van hefboomen en raderen welke de beweging weder overbrengen op de schroefstang deze schroef welker middellijn zes meter bedraagt kan 120 omwentelingen de seconde doen"
0.022727, "goed kapitein maar nu stuiten wij juist op de grootste moeielijkheid dat gij juist onder het wateroppervlak drijven kunt begrijp ik maar als gij lager wilt zakken ontmoet uw vaartuig dan geen drukking van beneden naar boven van een kilogram op den vierkanten centimeter"
0.025641, "toen ik het toenemend gewicht wilde berekenen dat ik aan de nautilus geven moest om haar dieper te doen zinken behoefde ik slechts acht te geven op de vermindering volumen welke het zeewater ondergaat naarmate men dieper zee daalt"
0.047619, "bravo kapitein" riep ik uit "maar hoe kan de stuurman den weg volgen welken gij hem het midden der zee aanwijst"
0.018868, "ja mijnheer" antwoordde de kapitein met wezenlijke aandoening "en ik heb dat schip zoo lief alsof het mijn vleesch en bloed ware indien op uwe gewone schepen gevaren u omringen indien men op zee het allereerst den indruk krijgt van een gevoel dat u naar den afgrond trekt zooals janssen het zoo nau0.017858, wkeurig gezegd heeft dan heeft de mensch de nautilus niets te vreezen geen lek want de dubbele huid heeft de sterkte van het ijzer geen tuig dat door het slingeren en stampen van het schip spoedig vernield geen zeilen welke de wind u voor den neus aan flarden scheurt geen ketels die door de hitte v0.020000, erteerd worden geen brand omdat het geheele schip van ijzer en niet van hout gemaakt geen kolen welke opraken omdat electriciteit zijne grootste kracht uitmaakt geen botsingen te vreezen omdat het alleen de diepten van de zee vaart geen storm te weerstaan omdat het schip eenige meters reeds onder d0.020000, e oppervlakte eene volkomene stilte vindt dat nu het schip bij uitnemendheid mijnheer en indien het waar dat de ingenieur meer vertrouwen zijn vaartuig stelt dan de bouwmeester en de bouwmeester meer dan de kapitein zelf dan kunt gij begrijpen met welk een vertrouwen ik voor mijn nautilus bezield b0.058824, en als ik u zeg dat ik er de kapitein de ingenieur en de bouwmeester van ben"
0.019608, het midden van het plat stak de sloep welke half het schip verborgen eenigermate uit voor en achter bevonden zich twee kooien van middelmatige hoogte met schuine wanden en voor een deel door groote lenzen gesloten de eene kooi voor den stuurman die de nautilus stuurde de andere schitterde het krach0.100000, tige electrieke licht dat het schip op zijn weg verlichtte
0.200000, "god beware ons" zeide ik
0.018868, "en nu mijnheer de professor laat ik u den tijd voor uwe ik heb gelast om ono te sturen op eene diepte van vijftig meter hier hebt gij kaarten met groote punten waarop gij onzen weg kunt volgen het salon ter uwer beschikking terwijl ik u de vergunning verzoek om mij te verwijderen"
0.090909, "waar zijn wij" riep ned uit "in het museum te quebec"
0.038462, "o" riep ik uit "nu begrijp ik het leven van dien man hij heeft zich een wereld afzonderlijk gevormd welke voor hem hare grootste wonderen bewaart"
0.125000, "en de onderverdeeling van die beide groote klassen"
0.050000, "welnu vriend koen" viel de harpoenier hem de rede terwijl hij tegen het raam leunde "daar heb je verscheidenheid genoeg"
0.500000, hoofdstuk xv
0.142857, "die lucht moet toch spoedig verbruikt zijn"
0.021739, de bodem helde voortdurend zoodat wij nog grooter diepten bereikten het zal omstreeks drie uur geweest zijn toen wij eene nauwe vallei tusschen twee steile rotswanden op ongeveer 150 meter diepte kwamen beschermd door de voortreffelijkheid onzer kleeding en toestellen waren wij dus 90 meter dieper 0.020000, afgedaald dan de natuur tot nog toe den mensch bij zijn onderzoek van de zee veroorloofd ik zeg 150 meter hoewel ik dit met geen enkel werktuig kan bewijzen maar ik weet dat zelfs het helderste zeewater de zonnestralen niet dieper kunnen doordringen en juist nu begon hier ondoordringbare duisternis0.020000,  te heerschen op geen tien pas afstands konden wij eenig voorwerp onderscheiden ik liep dus op den tast toen ik plotseling een vrij scherp wit licht zag schitteren de kapitein zijn electriek toestel werking gebracht zijn makker volgde zijn voorbeeld evenals koenraad en ik door een schroefje om te d0.040000, raaien bracht ik de klos met de glazen buis gemeenschap en de zee werd door onze vier lantaarns een omtrek van 25 meter helder verlicht
0.019608, den volgenden dag 18 november ik van mijne vermoeienis van den vorigen dag geheel bekomen ik besteeg het plat van de nautilus op het oogenblik dat de tweede stuurman zijne dagelijksche formule uitsprak ik verbeeldde mij toen dat dit zag op den toestand der zee liever dat het beteekende "wij hebben 0.021739, niets het gezicht" inderdaad de oceaan geheel verlaten geen enkel zeil verscheen aan den gezichteinder de hoogten van het eiland crespo waren gedurende den nacht verdwenen de zee eene schoone blauwe kleur aangenomen en eene zachte deining bracht er regelmatige rimpels op ik bewonderde het prachtige0.027027,  gezicht op den oceaan toen de kapitein verscheen hij scheen mij niet te zien en begon eene reeks sterrekundige waarnemingen toen hij gedaan ging hij op de lantaarn liggen leunen en liet zijne blikken de zee dwalen
0.040000, bijna dagelijks openden zich gedurende eenige uren de wanden der zaal en wij werden niet moede om de geheimen van die onderzeesche wereld te bespieden
0.020000, het algemeen de richting van de nautilus zuidoostwaarts en zij bleef op eene gemiddelde diepte van 200 150 meter eens evenwel ik weet niet om welke reden richtte het schip zich vrij snel naar beneden en bereikte eene diepte van 2000 meter de honderdgradige thermometer wees eene temperatuur aan van 0.083333, 25' welke op deze diepte onder alle breedten dezelfde schijnt te zijn
0.019608, ik stond op ging voor het glas op de ellebogen liggen en keek midden het electrieke licht hing eene groote zwarte massa onbeweeglijk het water ik bekeek het nauwkeurig om daardoor den aard van dit reusachtige dier naar ik meende te herkennen maar plotseling kwam mij eene gedachte voor den geest
0.090909, "om die muren te vormen" zeide hij aarzelend "zijn er dus"
0.022222, toen de nautilus weder op de oppervlakte kwam kon ik het lage en boschrijke eiland clermont tonnerre zijn geheelen omvang zien de koraalrotsen waren vermoedelijk door stormen vruchtbaar gemaakt eens zeker een zaadje door een orkaan van naburige eilanden op deze kalkrotsen overgewaaid waarop verrott0.021277, e visschen en zeeplanten vruchtbare aarde hadden gevormd een kokosnoot werd door de golven voortgestuwd en op deze kust geworpen de noot ontkiemde en schoot wortels de boom groeide op en hield den waterdamp tegen zoo ontstond een stroompje langzamerhand nam het plantenrijk toe eenige diertjes worme0.023256, n insecten kwamen op boomstronken aandrijven welke de wind op andere eilanden losgerukt schildpadden kwamen hare eieren leggen vogels nestelden den jonge boomen zoo ontwikkelde zich het dierlijk leven en door de vruchtbaarheid aangetrokken verscheen de mensch op deze wijze vormen onzichtbare diertj0.500000, es eilanden
0.021277, tasman ontdekte deze groep 1643 hetzelfde jaar waarin toricelli den barometer uitvond en dat lodewijk xiv den troon beklom ik laat daar welke van deze drie gebeurtenissen het nuttigst voor de menschheid geweest daarna kwamen er cook 1714 entrecasteaux 1793 en eindelijk 1827 durmont d'urville die de0.027778, zen geographischen chaos eerst goed onderzocht en beschreef de nautilus naderde de baai van wailea het tooneel van de vreeselijke lotgevallen van dien kapitein dillon die het eerst het geheim ontdekte van de schipbreuk van la
0.125000, "brengt de nautilus ons naar vanikoro" vroeg ik
0.058824, door den kapitein gevolgd ging ik naar het plat en keek met begeerige blikken naar den gezichteinder
0.020408, toen de nautilus den buitensten rotsrand door eene zeer nauwe opening binnen gevaren vonden wij daar binnen eene branding met dertig tot veertig vademen diepte onder de dichte schaduw der palmboomen zag ik een dozijn wilden staan die hoogst verbaasd onze komst opkeken meenden zij mogelijk dat dit l0.055563, ange zwarte lichaam dat slechts even boven water uitstak een vreeselijk zeemonster waarvoor zij zich acht moesten nemen
0.100000, dit ongeveer het verhaal dat ik aan kapitein nemo deed
0.142857, "en hoe weet gij dat" vroeg ik
0.019231, kapitein nemo liet mij een blikken doos zien waarop het wapen van frankrijk stond ingeslagen en die geheel door het zeewater ingevreten hij opende haar en ik zag een aantal geel geworden doch nog leesbare papieren het waren de van den minister van marine aan la op welker kant lodewijk xvi eigenhand0.250000, ig eenige aanteekeningen gemaakt
0.066667, den 1sten januari 1868 kwam koenraad zeer vroeg den morgen op het plat bij mij
0.071429, "ik kan het hem wel eens vragen" antwoordde ik doch hij zal het weigeren
0.066667, "ik geloof het ook niet" antwoordde ik "maar hij zal er niet van willen proeven"
0.100000, "vooral als men lang geen brood gehad heeft" zeide koen
0.052632, "zeker ned" zeide ik "gij hebt ons karbonaden beloofd die tot het rijk der fabelen schijnen te blijven behooren"
0.125000, "maar hoe laat het dan" vroeg de amerikaan
0.035714, "ja mijnheer dronken van de muskaatnoten welke hij onder den boom waar ik hem gevangen heb opvrat kijk eens vriend ned wat het vreeselijk gevolg der onmatigheid is"
0.023810, wij waren zeer tevreden den uitslag onzer jacht de vroolijke ned stelde zich voor om den volgenden dag naar dit bekoorlijke eiland terug te keeren dat hij zoo het scheen van alle eetbare dieren berooven wilde doch hij rekende buiten den waard
0.090909, "en die wilden" vroeg koenraad "zij schijnen zoo erg boos niet"
0.166667, "het zijn toch menscheneters mijn jongen"
0.043479, "mijnheer kan mij gerust gelooven" zeide koenraad terwijl hij de kostbare schelp met bevende hand aanvatte "ik ben nog nooit zoo blijde geweest"
0.250000, "koen" riep ik "koen"
0.055556, "ja mijnheer" het korte antwoord "doch ik geloof dat gij ernstige redenen hebt om bij mij te komen"
0.166667, "juist en ik kwam u zeggen"
0.022727, "het reeds geschied mijnheer" zeide hij na eenige oogenblikken "de sloep op hare plaats en het luik dicht gij vreest toch zeker niet dat die heeren de wanden van mijn vaartuig verbrijzelen zullen waar de kogels van uw fregat zelfs geen schade aan toebrachten"
0.019231, na deze woorden wilde ik heengaan doch de kapitein hield mij terug en verzocht mij bij hem plaats te nemen hij vroeg met veel belangstelling naar onzen tocht op het land naar onze jacht en scheen niet te begrijpen hoe die amerikaan zoo vurig naar vleesch verlangde daarna spraken wij verschillende o0.076923, nderwerpen en zonder daarom veel mede te deelen de kapitein inderdaad veel hartelijker
0.020000, daarna gingen wij met de kaart de hand de tochten van den franschen zeereiziger na zijne reis om de aarde zijne beide pogingen om aan de zuidpool door te dringen waardoor de landen amalia en lodewijk filips ontdekt werden en eindelijk zijne opmetingen van de voornaamste eilanden den grooten oceaan
0.025641, toen hij deze woorden kortaf gezegd maakte hij eene lichte buiging hij gaf mij dus mijn afscheid en ik ging naar mijne hut daar vond ik koenraad die wenschte te weten welken uitslag mijn gesprek met den kapitein gehad
0.111111, "ik heb bevel gegeven om het luik te openen"
0.018868, van nu af richtte de nautilus zich naar het zuidwesten en zette koers naar den indischen oceaan waar zou de kapitein ons nu heen voeren zou hij de aziatische kust weder opzoeken zou hij naar europa gaan dit niet zeer waarschijnlijk van iemand die het bewoonde land vermeed zou hij den steven zuidwaa0.020833, rts richten zou hij om de kaap de goede hoop en verder om kaap hoorn varen om tot aan de zuidpool door te dringen zou hij soms ook naar den grooten oceaan terug keeren waar zijn nautilus zulk een gemakkelijk vaarwater vond de toekomst zou het ons leeren
0.040000, "goed" antwoordde ik "maar de nautilus eene wereld op zich zelf en de geheimen van uwe geleerdheid zullen op de bewoonde aarde nooit bekend worden"
0.017544, de nautilus bevond zich den 18den januari op l en z b het weder ruw en de zee onstuimig het woei vrij sterk uit het oosten de barometer die sinds eenige dagen daalde kondigde een naderenden strijd der elementen aan ik stond op het plat op het oogenblik dat de tweede stuurman de hoogte nam ik wachtt0.024390, e zooals gewoonlijk de dagelijks uitgesproken formule maar plaats daarvan riep hij eenige andere niet minder onbegrijpelijke woorden bijna onmiddellijk verscheen de kapitein die een kijker naar den gezichteinder richtte hij bleef gedurende eenige oogenblikken onbeweeglijk zonder zijne blikken van e0.020000, en bepaald punt af te wenden toen liet hij zijn kijker zakken en wisselde eenige woorden met den stuurman deze scheen ten prooi aan eene ontroering welke hij te vergeefs trachtte te onderdrukken de kapitein scheen zich zelven beter te kunnen beheerschen en bleef koel overigens scheen hij den stuurm0.020834, an eenige tegenwerpingen te maken waarop deze met bepaalde zekerheid scheen te antwoorden ten minste ik begreep het zoo uit verschil van stem en gebaren wat mij aangaat ik keek nauwkeurig de aangeduide richting echter zonder iets te zien water en lucht vloeiden aan den gezichteinder volmaakt elkand0.500000, "neen mijnheer"
0.019608, er viel hiertegen niets te zeggen maar slechts te gehoorzamen omdat alle tegenstand onmogelijk ik ging naar de hut van ned land en koenraad wie ik het besluit van den kapitein mededeelde men kan denken hoe die mededeeling door den amerikaan ontvangen werd wij hadden overigens geen tijd tot eenige v0.025641, erklaring vier matrozen wachtten aan de deur en brachten ons naar het vertrek waar wij den eersten nacht aan boord van de nautilus hadden doorgebracht ned land wilde zich verzetten doch als antwoord ging de deur achter ons dicht
0.019231, deze woorden stopten den harpoenier den mond wij gingen aan tafel en aten zonder verder een woord te spreken ik weinig koenraad deed zich altijd uit voorzichtigheid geweld aan en hoezeer ned ook geprutteld zoo liet hij het zich toch goed smaken en toen het ontbijt gedaan ging ieder een hoek zitten 0.019231, op dat oogenblik ging het licht waaronder wij zaten plotseling uit en liet ons de diepste duisternis ned sliep weldra en wat mij vooral verwonderde dat koenraad eveneens slaap viel ik vroeg mijzelven af wat hem zoo vast doen inslapen toen ik zelf eenige zwaarte op mijne oogleden begon te gevoelen m0.019231, ijne oogen die ik met geweld wilde open houden sloten zich onwillekeurig ik ten prooi aan eene smartelijke zinsverbijstering zeker men een slaapmiddel de door ons genuttigde spijzen gemengd het dus niet genoeg om ons op te sluiten ten einde ons het zien te beletten men moest ons ook slaap hebben om0.142857,  niets van des kapiteins plannen te hooren
0.038462, de nautilus kalm en geheimzinnig als altijd zij dreef op de oppervlakte en ging slechts met matige snelheid vooruit niets scheen aan boord veranderd te zijn
0.200000, ik aarzelde om te spreken
0.125005, "die man zal binnen twee uur dood zijn"
0.017242, op een teeken van den kapitein naderde een der mannen die op eenige voeten van het kruis een gat begon te graven met eene schop welke hij aan zijn gordel gedragen toen begreep ik alles deze open plek een kerkhof die kuil een graf dat lange voorwerp het lijk van den man die 's nachts gestorven de ka0.062500, pitein en zijne manschappen kwamen hier hun makker begraven op den bodem van den ontoegankelijken oceaan

0.020000, "bewoond land" zei mij ned land "is beter dan die eilandjes van waar men meer wilden dan reebokken ziet daar mijnheer zijn straat en spoorwegen engelsche fransche en hindoesteden men behoeft geen vijf kilometer te loopen om een landgenoot te ontmoeten zeg eens zou het oogenblik niet gekomen zijn om0.333333,  bakzeil te trekken"
0.018868, van het eiland keeling af begonnen wij minder snel te loopen de gang van het vaartuig veel grilliger daar wij soms tot op groote diepten afdaalden wij gingen tot op een diepte van twee drie kilometer zonder ooit te onderzoeken hoe diep die indische zee wel welker bodem een schietlood van dertien ki0.030303, lometer lengte niet kunnen bereiken wat de temperatuur dier diepten aangaat deze volgens den thermometer altijd onveranderd vier graden boven nul merkte ik op dat het water op minder diepen bodem altijd kouder
0.019231, den 27sten januari zagen wij aan den ingang der golf van bengalen verscheidene malen lijken die aan de oppervlakte dreven het waren lijken uit de indische steden door den ganges naar zee gestuwd en die door de gieren nog niet geheel verslonden waren maar de haaien ontbraken niet om die aasvogels hu0.166667, n noodlottig werk bij te staan
0.035714, "altijd nog" antwoordde kapitein nemo "hoewel deze visscherijen aan het vernuftigste volk der aarde behooren aan de engelschen wien zij door den vrede van amiens 1802 werden afgestaan"
0.071429, "welk een schandelijke belooning voor menschen die hun meesters rijk maken 't een gruwel"
0.043478, "goed" dacht ik "koen zal nooit met mij mee willen gaan en dat zal er mij van verschoonen om den kapitein te vergezellen"
0.041667, ik begon weer het boek van sirr te lezen maar ik doorbladerde het slechts werktuigelijk tusschen de regels zag ik de vreeselijke geopende kaken
0.100000, "over de visscherij zelf" vroeg ik "of de ongelukken die"
0.058824, "zeker" zei koenraad "maar kan mijnheer ons ook vertellen hoe men die parels uit de schelp haalt"
0.333333, "cleopatra" zei koenraad
0.142857, "dat geloof ik ook" zei de amerikaan
0.020408, ik beschouwde hem met bijzondere aandacht hij werkte geregeld voort en gedurende een half uur scheen hem geen enkel gevaar te bedreigen ik raakte dus reeds gewoon aan het schouwspel dier belangwekkende visscherij toen ik den hindoe op het oogenblik dat hij weer op den grond neerknielde eensklaps he0.023810, vig zag schrikken opstaan en een sprong doen om weer naar boven te komen ik begreep zijn ontsteltenis een reusachtige schaduw vertoonde zich boven den ongelukkigen duiker het een groote haai die met vurig oog en geopende kaken dwars op hem aankwam
0.500000, hoofdstuk xxviii
0.100000, "neen mijnheer de professor en dit om een goede reden"
0.019231, "ja mijnheer aronnax gij hebt reden om op uw landgenoot fier te zijn hij een man die eene natie meer tot eer verstrekt dan de grootste veldheeren hij evenals vele anderen met moeielijkheden en tegenstand te kampen maar hij heeft gezegevierd want hij bezat een vasten wil het treurig als men bedenkt 0.024390, dat dit werk dat door alle te zamen moeten ondernomen worden en dat voldoende zou geweest zijn om de regeering van een vorst beroemd te maken slechts gelukt door de geestkracht van een enkel man eere zij dus aan de lesseps"
0.100000, "het verwondert mij dat wij er overmorgen reeds zullen zijn"
0.041670, "ja een onderaardsche doorgang waaraan ik den naam van arabischen tunnel gegeven heb deze begint even beneden suez en eindigt de golf van pelusium"
0.200000, "een anderen nautilus" vroeg koenraad
0.020000, den volgenden dag 11 februari werd de kombuis van den nautilus nogmaals van lekker wildbraad voorzien een vlucht zeezwaluwen sloeg op den nautilus neer het een soort zwaluw die bijzonder egypte te huis behoort met zwarten bek grijzen en gespikkelden kop met witte vlekjes om het oog met grijzen rug 0.033334, vleugels en staart witte borst en buik en roode pootjes ook vingen wij eenige dozijnen nijleenden wilde vogels met sterken smaak wier kop en hals wit met zwarte vlekken zijn
0.024390, "neen mijnheer ook ben ik gewoon dan zelf aan het roer te gaan als gij nu naar beneden wilt mijnheer aronnax dan kan de nautilus zee duiken om niet eer weer aan de oppervlakte te verschijnen wij den tunnel door zijn"
0.083333, "jawel van nacht zijn wij eenige minuten onder de onovergankelijke landengte heengevaren"
0.111111, "ja wel" zei de amerikaan "of de volle laag"
0.066667, "juist en zul je nu eens zeggen ned wat je door een gunstige gelegenheid verstaat"
0.022222, dit gesprek dat later zulke zwaarwichtige gevolgen hebben moest eindigde hiermede ik moet nu bekennen dat de gebeurtenissen mijn voorspelling tot groote teleurstelling van den amerikaan schenen te bevestigen wantrouwde de kapitein ons die druk bevaren wilde hij zich slechts onttrekken aan het oog d0.019609, er tallooze schepen van allerlei die de middellandsche zee doorkliefden ik weet het niet maar meestentijds bleef hij onder water en ver van de kust de nautilus kwam soms slechts even boven zoodat de uitkijk van den stuurman ternauwernood uit het water stak wij voeren op groote diepte daar wij tussc0.071429, hen den griekschen archipel en zelfs op 2000 meter den bodem niet konden bereiken
0.018182, den volgenden dag 14 februari besloot ik eenige uren te besteden aan het bestudeeren van de visschen uit dien archipel maar om de een andere reden bleven de wanden vast gesloten toen ik naging op welke hoogte de nautilus zich bevond merkte ik op dat wij naar candia voeren op het oogenblik dat ik mi0.021277, j op de abraham lincoln ingescheept dit geheele eiland opstand gekomen tegen de turksche overheersching maar ik wist volstrekt niet wat er van dien opstand tot heden toe geworden terwijl de kapitein die geen gemeenschap met het land onderhield mij het zeker niet zou hebben kunnen zeggen
0.111111, op dit oogenblik wendde kapitein nemo zich tot mij
0.018868, "dan wensch ik u een goeden nacht mijnheer" en daarop verliet hij den salon ik ging zooals men denken kan zeer nieuwsgierig naar mijn kamer ik zocht verband tusschen de verschijning van den zwemmer en die met goud gevulde kist weldra voelde ik aan eenige slingering dat de nautilus uit de diepte naa0.017857, r boven kwam en aan de oppervlakte dreef toen hoorde ik op het plat loopen ik begreep dat men de sloep los maakte en zee bracht een oogenblik stiet zij tegen den nautilus en toen alles stil twee uren daarna hoorde ik weer hetzelfde geraas en hetzelfde geloop de sloep werd aan boord geheschen en vas0.125000, tgeschroefd waarna de nautilus weer de diepte zonk
0.083333, "neen maar ik kan mij van het punt verwijderen waar zij ontstaat"
0.200000, "komt zij dan van buiten"
0.500000, hoofdstuk xxxi
0.200000, "neen niet zoover ik weet"
0.020833, ik vroeg mij zelven af wat kapitein nemo wel van onze ontsnapping zou denken welke ongerustheid welk leedwezen deze hem misschien zou veroorzaken en wat hij doen zou ingeval hem ons plan bekend werd het mislukte ik mij ongetwijfeld niet hem te beklagen integendeel nimmer werd gastvrijheid gulhartig0.018519, er aangeboden dan de zijne doch als ik hem verliet kon ik toch niet van ondankbaarheid worden beschuldigd want geen eed verbond ons aan hem hij rekende op den drang der omstandigheden niet op ons woord om ons voor altijd aan hem te verbinden hij ronduit bekend dat hij ons altijd gevangen zou houden0.200000,  en dit rechtvaardigde ons voornemen
0.066667, "wist gij mijnheer de professor" vroeg hij mij glimlachend "dat de zee zoovele rijkdommen bevatte"
0.333333, een verdwenen land
0.025641, ik wachtte met zeker ongeduld dat onze richting op de kaart zou worden aangeteekend tegen half twaalf liepen de vergaarbakken ledig en het vaartuig kwam weer aan de oppervlakte ik ging naar het plat ned land er reeds mij
0.043478, "gij hebt de diepte der zee alleen bij dag en zonlicht bezocht zoudt gij ze niet eens bij een duisteren nacht willen zien"
0.020000, de kleedkamer gekomen zag ik dat noch mijn makkers noch iemand van de bemanning ons op dien tocht zouden volgen de kapitein mij zelfs niet voorgesteld ned koen mee te nemen binnen weinige oogenblikken hadden wij onze toestellen aan men plaatste de luchtschouders op onzen rug doch de electrische lam0.052632, pen werden ons niet gegeven ik merkte dit den kapitein op "zij zullen ons geen nut doen" zei hij
0.023256, dit gedeelte van den oceaan heeft men het bestaan van een aantal onderzeesche vulkanen bewezen en verscheidene schepen hebben buitengewone schokken ondervonden als zij op deze hoogte voeren sommigen hoorden doffe geluiden den strijd der elementen te kennen gevende anderen hebben vulkaanasch opgevan0.022222, gen uit zee naar boven geworpen de geheele bodem tot aan den evenaar toe wordt nog door onderaardsche vulkanische krachten geteisterd en wie weet eenige eeuwen de toppen dezer vuurspuwende bergen hooger geworden door plutonische uitwerpselen en opeenvolgende lavabeddingen niet boven het vlak van de0.200000, n atlantischen oceaan zullen uitsteken
0.022727, een talloos visschenheir toch trok zijn oogen en als er visschen voorbij ons zwommen dan behoorde koenraad zijn lust tot ordenen en rangschikken als verzonken niet meer tot deze wereld dat geval moest ik hem gewoonlijk maar volgen en met hem onze ichthyologische voortzetten
0.040000, "inderdaad kapitein hier zijt gij veilig wie zou u het hart van een vulkaan kunnen achterhalen maar heb ik aan den top geen opening ontdekt"
0.037037, "zeer goed" antwoordde ned land "ik geloof u maar ons belang betreur ik het dat die opening waarvan mijnheer spreekt niet boven het vlak der zee ligt"
0.018519, wij moesten wederom naar beneden want wij konden onmogelijk verder boven ons geleek de gapende krater op de opening van een put wij konden den hemel vrij duidelijk zien en ik zag de wolken oostwaarts drijven een half uur na de laatste heldendaad van ned land waren wij weer aan den oever hier groeid0.037037, e niets meer dan wat zeevenkel een klein plantje dat goed om gekonfijt te worden koenraad plukte er eenige bosjes van verder vonden wij een menigte schelpdieren
0.021739, ik deel maury's gevoelen en heb het verschijnsel op de plaats zelf waar schepen slechts zeer zelden komen kunnen onderzoeken boven ons dreven voorwerpen van allerhande soort opgehoopt tusschen het bruinachtig gras boomstammen die van de andes en het rotsgebergte waren afgescheurd en door de amazone0.021739, nrivier de mississippi werden voortgestuwd tallooze overblijfselen van wrakken zoo met schelpen en planten begroeid dat zij niet boven konden drijven en de tijd zal ook eens dat andere gevoelen van maury waar maken dat deze eeuwenlang opgehoopte voorwerpen eenmaal versteenen en door de werking van 0.033334, het water een onuitputtelijke kolenmijn zullen vormen een kostbare voorraad dus dien de voorzienigheid nu reeds verzamelt voor het oogenblik dat de menschen de mijnen op het vasteland hebben uitgeput
0.021739, den geheelen 22sten februari brachten wij die krooszee door waar de visschen die zooveel van zeeplanten houden en de schaaldieren overvloedig voedsel vinden den volgenden dag de oceaan wederom zijn gewone voorkomen van dit oogenblik af bleef de nautilus gedurende negentien dagen van 23 februari tot0.020000,  12 maart het midden van den atlantischen oceaan en voerde ons mee met een doorloopende snelheid van zestien kilometer het uur de kapitein wilde waarschijnlijk het geheele programma zijner onderzeesche reis afloopen en ik twijfelde er niet aan hij zou na om kaap hoorn te zijn gestevend naar de stil0.018182, le zuidzee terugkeeren ned land dus wel gelijk met bang te zijn deze uitgestrekte zee zonder eilanden behoefde men het niet te beproeven om van boord te gaan wij hadden dus geen middel om ons tegen den wil van kapitein nemo te verzetten het eenige wat wij doen konden ons te onderwerpen maar wat men0.018868,  van geweld list niet meer te wachten dacht ik dat door overreding kon verkregen worden als de reis afgeloopen zou dan de kapitein er niet toestemmen ons de vrijheid terug te geven onder eede van zijn bestaan nimmer te verraden wij zouden dien eed zeker hebben gehouden maar ik moest die teedere zaa0.020000, k met den kapitein zelf behandelen zou ik hem echter die vrijheid wel kunnen vragen hij bij het begin der reis niet op stelligen toon verklaard dat het geheim van zijn leven onze levenslange gevangenschap aan boord van de nautilus eischte moest mijn stilzwijgen gedurende vier maanden hem niet doen 0.020408, gelooven dat ik mij zonder morren dien toestand schikte als ik die zaak weder aanroerde zou het dan geen achterdocht bij hem opwekken die onze plannen kon benadeelen als zich daartoe later eenige gunstige omstandigheid voordeed ik overdacht en overwoog al die redenen en ik onderwiep ze aan koenraad0.018868, s oordeel die niet minder verlegen stond dan ik kortom hoewel ik niet gemakkelijk uit het veld te slaan begreep ik toch dat de kans om mijn vrienden en bloedverwanten ook terug te zien van dag tot dag verminderde vooral nu kapitein nemo als een rechte waaghals stuurde naar het zuidelijk gedeelte va0.250000, n den atlantischen oceaan
0.034483, "neen mijnheer" antwoordde de kapitein "zoo onbeleefd zal ik niet zijn ik zal u echter vragen hoe gij het verklaart dat die dieren op zulk een diepte kunnen leven"
0.166668, "sta dan vast op uw beenen"
0.019231, voordat ik begreep waarom de kapitein mij dien raad gaf lag ik reeds op den grond toen men op een teeken van nemo de schroef en de buitenvlakken een andere richting gegeven vloog de nautilus als een ballon het luchtruim met bliksemsnelheid naar boven met hoorbare trilling boorde hij door de waterma0.022222, ssa wij konden niets zien vier minuten doorkliefde hij de zestien kilometer die ons van het vlak der zee scheidden en sprong toen als een vliegende visch boven het water uit waarin het vaartuig weer nederplofte terwijl de golven aan alle kanten ontzaglijk hoog opstoven
0.033333, "kijk eens kijk eens" riep de amerikaan met bewogen stem "hij nadert hij komt naar ons toe hij daagt mij uit hij weet wel dat ik onmachtig tegenover hem ben"
0.250000, "zoo ned en waarom"
0.062500, "en de roode zee" hernam ned "hebt u ons verlof gegeven om een dugong te verdelgen"
0.035714, "je hebt gelijk ned en toch zou ik wel eens willen weten wat er achter die ijsbank zit er niets dat mij boozer kan maken dan een muur"
0.200000, "vast hoe meent gij dat"
0.037037, "ja" antwoordde de kapitein koeltjes "naar de zuidpool naar dat onbekende punt waar alle meridianen samenvallen gij weet dat ik met den nautilus doe wat ik wil"
0.020000, "ik wil u gelooven kapitein" hernam ik op eenigszins spottenden toon "ik geloof u komaan voorwaarts er bestaan voor ons geen hinderpalen laten wij deze ijsbank doorbreken laten wij haar de lucht doen springen en als zij dan nog weerstand biedt moeten wij den nautilus vleugels aandoen om er overheen0.500000,  te vliegen"
0.019608, "als het oppervlak der zee" zei ik medegesleept door de redeneering van den kapitein "door het ijs onbevaarbaar dan de diepte toch vrij omdat de wetten der natuur daar het water door zijn grootere dichtheid een warmtegraad boven het vriespunt hebben gegeven en indien ik mij niet bedrieg dan staat h0.058825, et ijs van deze bank dat onder water tot dat wat er boven uitsteekt als vier tot
0.028572, "ik geloof het ook mijnheer aronnax" antwoordde kapitein nemo "ik zal u alleen nog doen opmerken dat gij na zoovele zwarigheden tegen mijn plan gemaakt te hebben mij nu met bewijsgronden ten voordeele daarvan overstelpt"
0.500000, hoofdstuk xxxviii
0.250000, "dat ontken ik niet"
0.019608, na het ontbijt ging ik aan wal de nautilus des nachts nog eenige kilometers opgevaren hij lag op ruim vier kilometer van de kust boven welke een bergtop van vier vijfhonderd meter uitstak behalve mijn persoon bevonden zich de sloep de kapitein twee zijner manschappen en de instrumenten dat te zegge0.125000, n een chronometer een kijker en een barometer
0.023810, "de zuidpool" antwoordde de kapitein met ernstige stem terwijl hij mij den kijker gaf waardoor ik kon zien dat de dagvorst door den gezichteinder juist twee helften verdeeld ik zag de laatste stralen op de rotspunten terugkaatsen en de schaduwen langzamerhand toenemen
0.166667, "dat weten wij niet" antwoordde koenraad
0.142857, "waar hij te vinden" vroeg ned land
0.125000, "volgt mij" zei ik tot mijn beide makkers
0.033333, wij verlieten den salon de bibliotheek niemand ik dacht dat de kapitein misschien bij den stuurman het beste dus hem te wachten waarom wij alle drie naar den salon teruggingen
0.022727, "als wij weer aan land komen" voegde koenraad er bij "zullen wij verzadigd zijn van al die wonderen maar wat zullen wij dan wel denken van die ellendige landjes en al dat nietige werk van menschenhanden neen de bewoonde aarde onzer niet meer waardig"
0.019608, het toen vijf uur den morgen op dat oogenblik stiet de voorsteven van den nautilus ik begreep dat de ijzeren spoor tegen een ijsblok gestooten misschien het een klein toeval want die onderzeesche tunnel hier en daar door ijsblokken verstopt moest niet gemakkelijk te bevaren zijn ik dacht dus dat ka0.023810, pitein nemo zijn tocht zou wijzigen en de hinderpalen te boven komen al de kronkelingen van den tunnel zou volgen allen gevalle kon onze tocht voorwaarts niet geheel en al verhinderd worden doch tegen mijn verwachting begon de nautilus achteruit te loopen
0.052632, "dan onze beweging gemakkelijk te verklaren wij gaan achteruit en zullen er door de zuidelijke opening uitkomen dat alles"
0.020000, derhalve een ondoordringbare ijsmuur boven beneden en rondom den nautilus wij zaten de ijsbank gevangen de amerikaan sloeg met de vuist op de tafel koenraad zweeg ik keek den kapitein aan zijn gelaat de gewone kalmte hernomen hij de armen elkander geslagen en scheen na te denken de nautilus bewoog 0.125000, zich niet daarna nam de kapitein het woord
0.050000, "vijf nachten en vier dagen" zei ik tot mijn makkers "en wij hebben maar voor twee dagen lucht onze vergaarbakken"
0.019231, spoedig hadden wij onze krachten terug en toen ik om mij heen zag bemerkte ik dat wij alleen op het plat waren niemand van de bemanning zelfs de kapitein niet de zonderlinge matrozen van den nautilus waren tevreden met de lucht die hun vaartuig drong niemand kwam van de vrije lucht genieten
0.047619, "ja mijnheer een natuurlijke barometer die mij nog nooit bedrogen heeft toen ik de buurt van de straat van magelhaen voer"
0.018519, op dat oogenblik teekende de top zich helder af tegen den blauwen hemel dit een voorteeken van schoon weder wij bedrogen ons niet toen de nautilus weer onder water gedoken naderde hij de kust waarlangs hij eenige kilometers ver heen voer door de ramen van den salon zag ik een menigte lianen en ande0.030303, re zeeplanten waartusschen schelp en weekdieren groote menigte nestelden otters en zeekalven speelden daartusschen rond en aten een menigte kleine dieren en planten op zoodat zij volgens engelsche mode visch met groenten gebruikten
0.076923, "krakens" ging koen voort zonder op de aardigheid van zijn makker te letten
0.142857, "in de kerk" riep de amerikaan uit
0.027778, werkelijk verschenen andere dieren voor het andere raam ik telden er zeven zij begeleidden den nautilus ik hoorde het krassen van hun bek tegen den ijzeren buitenwand van het schip wij werden op onze wenken gediend
0.200000, "hebben wij gestooten" vroeg ik
0.333333, "bevechten" vroeg ik
0.021277, niemand onzer zal ooit het vreeselijk tooneel van dien 20sten april vergeten ik heb het opgeschreven onder den indruk eener hevige gemoedsbeweging later heb ik dat verhaal nog eens nagezien ik heb het koenraad en den amerikaan voorgelezen zij vonden het feit nauwkeurig genoeg beschreven doch zeiden0.030303,  dat het den indruk nog niet genoeg terug gaf om zulke tafereelen te schilderen zou men de pen van een onzer uitmuntendste dichters van den schrijver der "travailleurs de la mer" moeten bezitten
0.018868, het dezen stroom dat de nautilus op dat oogenblik voer als hij het kanaal van bahama verlaat de golfstroom 56 kilometer breed en 350 meter diep en stroomt met een snelheid van acht kilometer het uur deze snelheid neemt geregeld af naarmate hij verder noordwaarts gaat en het te wenschen dat deze reg0.023810, elmatigheid blijft bestaan want als die snelheid zooals men wel eens heeft meenen op te merken en die richting zich wijzigden dan zou het klimaat europa wel eens zulk een verandering kunnen ondergaan dat de gevolgen er van niet te berekenen zijn
0.017544, "mijnheer" zei hij eens "daar moet een einde aan komen ik wil eindelijk weten waar ik mij aan te houden heb uw nemo gaat hoe langer hoe verder van land af en trekt weer naar het noorden doch ik verklaar u dat ik genoeg van de zuidpool heb en ik hem niet naar de noordpool zal volgen"
0.125000, "de vrijheid" zei kapitein nemo terwijl hij opstond
0.047619, "wie weigert u ditzelfde recht" antwoordde nemo "heb ik er ooit aan gedacht u door een eed aan mij te binden"
0.021739, de amerikanen verloren den moed niet de moedige cyrus field de drijver der geheele onderneming die er zijn geheele fortuin aan waagde opende een nieuwe inschrijving een nieuwe kabel werd met de meeste voorzorgen vervaardigd de geleidingsdraden waren van elkander afgezonderd door gutta percha en het0.020000,  geheel omwoeld met werk dat weer door een metalen buis werd beschermd de greateastern stak 13 juli 1866 weer zee het werk ging goed evenwel gebeurde er iets dat noodlottig kunnen worden verscheidene malen hadden de ingenieurs opgemerkt dat er kort te voren spijkers den kabel waren geslagen om deze0.021739, n van binnen te vernielen te bederven kapitein anderson hield een vergadering met zijn officieren en ingenieurs en daar werd besloten dat als de schuldige aan boord werd gevat hij zonder vonnis zee zou geworpen worden sedert dat oogenblik werd de misdadige poging niet weer gewaagd
0.018869, een belangrijke vraag deed zich toen voor mij voor zou de nautilus zich het kanaal durven wagen ned land die weer voor den dag gekomen sedert wij het land waren genaderd deed mij honderden vragen wat kon ik hem antwoorden kapitein nemo bleef onzichtbaar nadat hij den amerikaan even de kusten van zi0.076934, jn vaderland laten zien wilde hij mij misschien die van frankrijk even toonen
0.018519, hij ging door het luik naar beneden hij het stoomschip gezien dat langzamer liep en ons scheen te naderen ik zou het niet kunnen zeggen ik kwam den salon de luiken gingen dicht en ik hoorde het water de vergaarbakken stroomen de nautilus begon te zakken eenige minuten later bleef hij op een diepte 0.023810, van 833 meter op den bodem der zee rusten het licht aan de zoldering van den salon ging uit de ramen werden geopend en door het glas zag ik het zeewater op een halven kilometer de rondte sterk door onze lantaarn verlicht
0.142857, "waar komt die knal vandaan" vroeg ik
0.019608, de nacht kwam er heerschte doodelijke stilte aan boord het kompas deed ons zien dat de nautilus niet van richting veranderd ik hoorde het geraas van de schroef die zich met groote regelmatigheid bewoog het vaartuig bleef op de oppervlakte en een lichte deining deed het heen en weder schommelen mijn0.016667,  makkers en ik hadden besloten om te vluchten op het oogenblik dat het schip dicht genoeg bij hetzij om ons te hooren hetzij om ons te zien want de maan die drie dagen vol moest zijn stond helder aan den hemel als wij maar eerst aan boord van het schip waren zouden wij als wij den slag waar het med0.020408, e bedreigd werd niet konden afwenden alles doen wat ons vermogen stond en de omstandigheden ons zouden veroorloven verscheidene malen meende ik dat de nautilus zich gereed maakte tot den aanval maar hij vergenoegde zich met zijn vijand te laten naderen en dan zette hij na weinige oogenblikken zijn 0.500000, vlucht voort
0.021277, het schip bleef op twee kilometer afstands het naderbij gekomen altijd vooruitstoomende de richting van dien lichtglans die de tegenwoordigheid van den nautilus aanduidde ik zag het groene en roode seinlicht der stoomboot en de helderwitte lantaarn die aan den fokkemast hing het tuig werd door den 0.033333, maneschijn slechts flauw zee teruggekaatst en ik kon zien dat het de vuren vreeselijk opstookte een menigte vonken stukjes brandende kool vlogen uit de schoorsteenen als sterren door de lucht
0.018868, ik wierp een laatsten blik op al die natuurwonderen op al die kunstschatten welke dit museum op elkander waren gestapeld op de verzameling zonder weerga bestemd om eens de diepte der zee te verzinken met hem die haar gevormd ik wilde een laatsten indruk van dat alles mijn geest krijgen zoo bleef ik0.020833,  een uur den salon ronddwalen terwijl ik onder de stroomen van electrisch licht uit het plafond de onder de glazen schitterende rijkdommen bekeek toen ging ik weer naar mijn kamer daar deed ik dikker kleederen aan ik verzamelde mijn aanteekeningen en verborg die zorgvuldig mijn hart klopte hoorbaar0.018519,  zeker zouden mijn verwarring en onrust mij bij kapitein nemo verraden hebben wat deed hij op dat oogenblik ik luisterde aan de deur zijner kamer ik hoorde iemand loopen kapitein nemo daar hij niet naar bed gegaan bij elk geritsel scheen het mij toe dat hij verschijnen en mij vragen zou waarom ik w0.022222, ilde vluchten ik voortdurend onrust mijn verbeelding vermeerderde den angst dit werd sterk dat ik mij zei ven afvroeg het niet beter bij den kapitein zijn kamer te gaan hem eens ferm onder de oogen te zien en hem met blik en gebaar te tarten
0.250000, "aanstonds" antwoordde de amerikaan
0.024390, de maalstroom verschrikkelijker naam vreeselijker toestand kon ons zeker niet de ooren klinken waren wij dan op die gevaarlijke plek aan de kust van noorwegen werd de nautilus naar dien afgrond gesleept op het oogenblik dat wij de sloep zouden losmaken
