0.250000, het voor en tegen
0.021739, "de eenhoorn toch met een soort van ivoren spoor met een hellebaard gewapend zooals sommige natuurkenners dit voorwerp beschrijven het een slagtand zoo hard als staal men heeft eenige van die tanden gevonden waarmede het lichaam van walvisschen doorboord deze visch namelijk wordt door den eenhoorn 0.020833, altijd met goeden uitslag aangevallen anderen werden niet zonder inspanning uit den romp van schepen getrokken welke zij geheel doorboord hadden evenals een drilboor door een vat gaat het museum van de geneeskundige faculteit te parijs bezit een van die hoorns welke eene lengte van 225 en onderaan 0.166667, eene breedte van o48 meter heeft
0.020000, "welnu veronderstel zulk een wapen tienmaal zoo sterk en het dier tienmaal zoo krachtig verbeeld u dat het zich met eene snelheid van twintig kilometer het uur beweegt vermenigvuldig het gewicht met de snelheid en gij verkrijgt tot resultaat een schok die wel staat om het bedoelde ongeluk te veroor0.021739, zaken voordat ik nader word ingelicht houd ik het er dus voor dat het een zeeeenhoorn geweest van verbazende grootte niet met een hellebaard maar met eene wezenlijke spoor gewapend zooals gepantserde fregatten ramschepen die hebben zoo zou dit onverklaarbaar verschijnsel zijn opgelost ofer moet nie0.055556, ts bestaan weerwil van al hetgeen men gegist gezien en gevoeld heeft hetgeen ook nog wel mogelijk is"
0.020833, toen de openbare meening uitspraak gedaan verklaarden de vereenigde staten zich het eerst men maakte te newyork toebereidselen voor een tocht om den eenhoorn te vervolgen een fregat met eene spoor voorzien en van groote snelheid de abraham lincoln werd uitgerust om zoodra mogelijk zee te kiezen de 0.045455, kapitein farragut vrije beschikking de tuighuizen en hij maakte daarvan een goed gebruik om zijn fregat zoo snel mogelijk uit te russen
0.062500, "koen" riep ik nog eens terwijl ik koortsige haast toebereidselen tot mijn vertrek begon te maken
0.111111, "keeren wij dus niet naar parijs terug" vroeg koenraad
0.055559, "denk er goed na want ik wil u niets verbergen het eene reis waarvan men niet altijd terugkeert"
0.166667, "hebben wij drukking genoeg" vroeg hij
0.333333, "hoor eens ned"
0.200000, "welnu heb ik u overtuigd"
0.027027, maar ijdele hoop de abraham lincoln veranderde van koers stoomde op het aangewezen dier los en als men het naderde bleek het slechts een gewone walvisch gemeene potvisch te zijn die weldra onder tal van verwenschingen verdween
0.020408, dat nutteloos zoeken kon echter niet lang meer worden voortgezet de abraham lincoln zich niets te verwijten daar alles gedaan om te slagen geene equipage van eenig amerikaansch schip toonde ooit zooveel geduld en zooveel ijver het mislukken kon haar niet geweten worden men kon niets anders doen dan0.020000, deze belofte werd op den 2den november gedaan zij ten minste ten gevolge dat de moed van het scheepsvolk er een weinig door werd opgebeurd men bekeek den oceaan weder met vernieuwde oplettendheid elkeen wilde er nog een laatsten blik op slaan de kijkers werden weder met koortsige bedrijvigheid aan 0.045455, het oog gebracht het eene laatste uitdaging aan den reus en deze kon redelijkerwijze niet nalaten daaraan te beantwoorden door te verschijnen
0.500000, hoofdstuk vii
0.032258, plotseling werd ik door een krachtige hand bij mijn kleeren gegrepen ik voelde mij naar de oppervlakte slepen en ik hoordeja waarachtig ik hoorde mij de volgende woorden het oor roepen
0.100001, "heeft die schok u te gelijk met mij zee geworpen"
0.083333, "mijnheer los laten nooit" riep hij "ik hoop nog mijnheer te verdrinken"
0.027778, koenraad spande eene laatste poging hij richtte zich op mijne schouders op terwijl ik hem met inspanning mijner laatste krachten ondersteunde hij hief zich ten halvenlijve uit het water op en viel toen uitgeput weer neer
0.040000, "natuurlijk" antwoordde de harpoenier "en toch heeft dit drijvend eiland gedurende de drie uur dat ik er op zit nog geen teeken van leven gegeven"
0.021277, "wij weten toch zonder er aan te mogen twijfelen dat het met groote snelheid vooruit kan komen en daar er eene machine noodig om die snelheid voort te brengen en een machinist om de machine te besturen zoo houd ik het er voor dat wij gered zijn"
0.020000, onwillekeurig voelde ik mij zijne tegenwoordigheid zeker en ik voorspelde mij veel goeds van die samenkomst die man 35 50 jaar ik zou het niet juist hebben kunnen zeggen hij lang van gestalte een breed voorhoofd een fijnen rechten neus een scherp geteekenden mond prachtige tanden en schoone lange h0.020834, anden hij zeker wel de verwonderlijkste type welke ik ooit ontmoet als iets bijzonders merkte ik op dat zijne oogen welke een weinig ver van elkander stonden tegelijk een vierde gedeelte van den gezichteinder konden omvatten waardoor zooals mij later bewezen werd zijn gezicht nog veel scherper dan 0.019231, dat van ned land als die onbekende naar eenig voorwerp zag fronste hij de wenkbrauwen trok het oog zoo te samen dat slechts de pupil zichtbaar bleef beperkte daardoor den blik tot het bedoelde voorwerp en keek maar met welk een blik hoe werden de door den afstand kleiner wordende voorwerpen verduid0.037037, elijkt hoe drong die blik de ziel door hoe drong hij ook door die vloeistof welke voor ons oog ondoorzichtig hoe las hij de diepten der zee
0.021739, en koenraad vertelde met de grootste bedaardheid voor de derde maal onze lotgevallen maar niettegenstaande de fraaie volzinnen en het schoone stemgeluid van den verteller slaagde het duitsch evenmin eindelijk tot het uiterste gebracht trachtte ik mij alles nog te herinneren wat mij van mijne eerste0.027029,  bijgebleven en ik poogde hun onze geschiedenis het latijn te vertellen cicero zou zich de ooren hebben toegestopt en mij naar de keuken gejaagd maar ik bracht het er redelijk wel af de uitslag echter even ontmoedigend
0.100000, "mijn oordeel reeds gevormd" antwoordde ned land "het zijn schelmen"
0.125000, "och" zeide koenraad "er zijn zulke onbegrijpelijke menschen"
0.142857, "dat zullen wij eens zien" zeide koenraad
0.047619, "maar mijnheer aronnax ik kan de verte zelfs niet gissen hoe laat het het moest het uur van het middagmaal zijn"
0.200000, "en wat dan baas land"
0.250014, de man der zee
0.055556, "gij begrijpt dus mijnheer" hervatte de onbekende "dat ik het recht heb om u als vijanden te beschouwen"
0.062500, "gij geeft ons dus eenvoudig weg te kiezen tusschen het leven en den dood" hernam ik
0.025641, de kapitein riep een hofmeester verscheen aan wien hij zijne vreemde voor mij onverstaanbare taal eenige bevelen gaf daarop wendde hij zich naar ned land en koenraad en zeide "een maal wacht u uwe hut volgt dien man slechts"
0.050000, "waar kan ik beter de eenzaamheid en meer stilte vinden" antwoordde de kapitein "is uw studeervertrek het museum zoo rustig"
0.090909, "eene rookkamer" riep ik uit "wordt er dan aan boord gerookt"
0.033333, "neen" antwoordde de kapitein "die tabak komt niet uit havana uit het eene soort van nicotinehoudend zeegras dat de zee hoewel vrij schaars oplevert betreurt gij uwe havana's nog mijnheer"
0.025000, rondom die fontein waren onder sierlijke glazen ramen de kostbaarste voortbrengselen der zee gerangschikt welke het oog eens natuuronderzoekers ooit aanschouwd men kan begrijpen hoe opgetogen ik een conchylioloog (schelpkenner) die wat zenuwachtig zou misschien van verbazing zijn omvergevallen voor0.020408,  andere glazen kastjes waarin schelpen waren tentoongesteld ik zag er eene verzameling van onschatbare waarde waartoe de tijd mij zou ontbreken om die geheel te beschrijven genoeg zij het te zeggen dat zij uit alle oorden der wereld uit alle deelen der zee bijeengebracht er waren paarlen onder van 0.020408, allerlei kleur en grootte zelfs zoo groot als een duivenei welke eene waarde van ettelijke millioenen moesten hebben het dus onmogelijk om de waarde van deze verzameling te schatten de kapitein millioenen moeten besteden om die kostbaarheden te verwerven en ik vroeg mij zelven af aan welke bron hij0.047619,  putte om aan al die grillen van een verzamelaar te voldoen toen ik door deze woorden uit mijne mijmering werd opgewekt
0.062500, "op mijn bevel een electrieke draad verbindt mij met het vaartuig ik telegrapheer en dat genoeg"
0.034483, "ik geloof het kapitein maar om te zien moet het licht de duisternis van die diepten toch vervangen en ik vroeg mijzelven af hoe het mogelijk om onder zee"
0.250000, "eene laatste vraag kapitein"
0.500000, "vraag mijnheer"
0.038462, ik wierp een laatsten blik op die zee welke eenigszins geelachtig gekleurd door het zand van de japansche kust en ik ging weder naar het salon
0.019231, "ik kan u daarop geen antwoord geven geloof mij laat voor het oogenblik dat denkbeeld varen om u van de nautilus meester te maken te vluchten dit vaartuig een van de grootste meesterstukken der nieuwere nijverheid en het zou mij spijten als ik het niet gezien velen zouden zich onzen toestand schikk0.033333, en al ware het alleen maar om te midden van al die wonderen rond te dolen houdt u dus stil en laat ons trachten te zien wat rondom ons gebeurt"
0.050000, "zien" riep de harpoenier "maar men ziet niets en zal nooit iets zien die ijzeren gevangenis wij varen den blinde"
0.047619, "neen" voegde ik hem toe "want een aquarium een kooi en hier zijn de visschen zoo vrij als vogels de lucht"
0.333333, eene schriftelijke uitnoodiging
0.066667, "ga uw gang mijnheer aronnax en als ik haar kan beantwoorden zal ik het doen"
0.250000, "zooals gij zegt mijnheer"
0.020408, de kracht van het licht dat den grond tot op tien meter onder water bescheen verwonderde mij de zonnestralen drongen gemakkelijk door en losten de kleur van het zeewater op ik onderscheidde voorwerpen op honderd meter afstand wat verder lag werd onduidelijk door tinten en ultramarijn en nog verder 0.026318, verloor het zich een ondoorschijnend blauw dat eindigde een zeker duister het water dat mij omringde inderdaad slechts eene soort van lucht wel dichter dan de aardsche dampkring doch even doorschijnend boven mij zag ik het kalme zeevlak
0.021739, gedurende een kwartier liep ik dat witte zand hetwelk met millioenen kleine schelpen bezaaid langzamerhand verdween de nautilus welke op eene langwerpige klip geleek uit het gezicht maar als het donker werd zou de electrieke lantaarn door haar helder licht ons den weg naar boord aanwijzen
0.021739, kapitein nemo drong steeds dieper voorwaarts het sombere woud waar de plantengroei langzamerhand zeldzamer werd ik merkte op dat de planten eerder ophielden dan de dieren en dat terwijl de bodem bijna geheel zonder plantentooi er een groot aantal dieren van allerhande soort door elkander krioelde
0.019608, op tien meter diepte gingen wij midden door een zwerm kleine visschen van allerhande soort veel talrijker dan de vogels de lucht en ook vlugger doch geen enkel stuk waterwild dat een schot waard zich nog aan ons voorgedaan toen ik den kapitein plotseling zijn geweer zag aanleggen en daarmede tussch0.033333, en de waterplanten een beweegbaar voorwerp volgen het schot ging af ik hoorde een licht gesis en als door den bliksem getroffen viel op eenige passen ons een dier neder
0.022727, ondertusschen waren een twintigtal matrozen allen krachtige en welgevormde mannen op het plat gekomen om de netten op te halen welke zij gedurende den nacht hadden laten slepen die zeelieden behoorden oogenschijnlijk tot verschillende hoewel zij allen duidelijk van europeesche afkomst waren ik herk0.023256, ende zonder aarzelen ieren franschen eenige en zelfs een griek een candioot overigens spraken die mannen zeer weinig en gebruikten onder elkander slechts die vreemde taal welker oorsprong ik zelfs niet raden kon derhalve moest ik er van afzien om hen te ondervragen
0.090909, "de pool zou die stoutmoedige reiziger ons daar heen willen brengen"
0.028571, na deze woorden verdween de kapitein door het luik ik volgde hem en trad het salon binnen de schroef begon aanstonds te werken en de log toonde eene snelheid van twintig kilometer 't uur aan
0.020408, de nautilus 800 kilometer afgelegd wij gingen door tusschen den archipel van tongatabou waar de argo de portauprince en de duke portland vergingen en dien van de schipperseilanden waar kapitein de langle de vriend van la vermoord werd daarna kwamen wij langs de witieilanden waar de wilden de matroz0.018519, en van de union en kapitein bureau van de aimable vermoordden deze archipel welke zich van het noorden naar het zuiden eene lengte van 400 en van het oosten naar het westen van 300 kilometer uitstrekt ligt tusschen en zb en en 179' wl hij bestaat uit een groot aantal eilandjes en klippen waaronder 0.125000, de eilanden witilewu en wannalewu de voornaamste zijn
0.018519, ik vertelde hem wat de laatste werken van dumont d'urville hadden medegedeeld la en de kapitein de langle werden 1785 door lodewijk xvi uitgezonden om eene reis om de aarde te doen zij voerden het bevel op de boussole en de astrolabe en kwamen nooit terug toen 1791 de fransche regeering met recht o0.020000, ngerust werd het lot van de twee korvetten rustte zij twee groote schepen uit de recherche en de deze schepen zeilden 28 september uit brest onder bevel van bruni d'entrecasteaux twee maanden daarna vernam men van zekeren bowen kapitein op de albemarle dat hij overblijfselen van schepen gezien op d0.021739, e kusten van maar d'entrecasteaux die deze overigens vrij onzekere mededeeling niet kende richtte zich naar de admiraliteitseilanden welke een verslag van kapitein hunter waren aangeduid als de plaats waar de schipbreuk van la plaats gehad zijn onderzoek te vergeefs de en de recherche zeilden zelfs0.032258,  voorbij vanikoro zonder er zich op te houden en bovendien deze reis zeer ongelukkig daar zij het leven aan d'entrecasteaux aan twee zijner stuurlieden en aan verscheiden matrozen zijner equipage kostte
0.022222, dillon raadde dat dit de schepen van la konden zijn wier verdwijning de geheele wereld ongerust gemaakt hij wilde naar vanikoro waar volgens den nog verschillende overblijfselen van de schipbreuk gevonden werden hij werd door tegenwind en zeestroomingen evenwel daarin verhinderd dillon kwam te calc0.024390, utta daar wist hij de aziatische maatschappij en de indische compagnie voor zijne ontdekking te winnen men stelde een schip waaraan men den naam van recherche gaf ter zijner beschikking en hij vertrok 23 januari 1827 gezelschap van een fransch agent
0.055556, "mijnheer" zeide de brave jongen "zal mij toch niet kwalijk nemen als ik hem een gelukkig nieuwjaar wensch"
0.018868, "wat koen evenmin als te parijs mijne studeerkamer ik neem uw wensch aan en dank u er voor alleen wil ik u vragen wat gij bedoelt met een gelukkig nieuwjaar de omstandigheden waarin wij ons bevinden het een jaar dat een einde aan onze gevangenschap maken moet een waarin wij deze vreemdsoortige reis0.500000,  zullen voortzetten"
0.022222, dit land 1511 door den portugees francisco serrano ontdekt werd achtereenvolgens bezocht door meneses 1526 door grijalva 1527 door den spaanschen generaal alvar de saavedra 1528 door juigo ortez 1545 door schouten 1616 door tasman carteret bougainville cook mac clure dumont d'urville en anderen "he0.045455, t de bakermat der maleische kleurlingen" zeide de rienzi doch ik dacht niet dat het toeval mij ooit zijne nabijheid brengen zou
0.033335, "die vervloekte kapitein" hernam de amerikaan "moet wel zeker van zijn weg zijn want ik zie daar riffen waarop zijne schuit duizend stukken zou splijten als hij er slechts aanraakte"
0.017544, "nu heeft vriend land gelijk" zeide koenraad "en ik ben het met hem eens zou mijnheer van zijn vriend den kapitein geen verlof kunnen krijgen om eens aan land te gaan al het alleen maar om de gewoonte niet te verliezen van nu en dan den voet eens te zetten op het vaste deel van onzen aardbodem"
0.250000, "op weg" riep koenraad
0.019231, eindelijk verlieten wij tegen vijf uur s'avonds met al onze schatten het eiland en een half uur daarna lagen wij weder naast de nautilus bij onze komst verscheen er niemand de groote ijzeren cylinder scheen verlaten toen wij onzen voorraad aan boord hadden ging ik naar mijne kamer waar het souper g0.018868, ereed stond ik en ging naar bed den volgenden morgen 6 januari gebeurde er niets bijzonders aan boord geen enkel gerucht geen enkel teeken van leven kwam tot mij de sloep naast het vaartuig blijven liggen op dezelfde plaats waar wij haar den vorigen avond gelaten hadden wij besloten nog eens naar h0.037037, et eiland gueboroar te gaan ned land hoopte op de jacht gelukkiger te zijn dan den vorigen dag en wilde een ander deel van het woud bezoeken
0.027027, "een viervoetig stuk wild mijnheer aronnax" antwoordde ned land "al die duiven dat maar bijwerk en een mondterging ik zal dan ook niet eer tevreden zijn voor ik een beest heb doodgeschoten waarvan ik karbonade kan eten"
0.100000, "en ik niet ned alvorens ik een paradijsvogel gevangen heb"
0.125000, "en weet mijnheer hoe die inboorlingen dat doen"
0.021739, ik geloof waarlijk dat als de amerikaan niet zooveel gepraat hij overmaat van blijdschap den geheelen troep zou doodgeschoten hebben maar hij stelde zich tevreden met een dozijn van die buideldieren zij waren klein van stuk het waren eigenlijk springkonijnen die holle boomen nestelen en ontzaglijk 0.076923, vlug zijn maar al zijn zij klein zoo hun vleesch toch bijzonder gezocht
0.023810, twintig minuten daarna waren wij aan boord het luik open nadat wij de boot hadden vastgelegd gingen wij naar binnen ik ging naar het salon waar ik enige accoorden hoorde aanslaan kapitein nemo zat daar voor het orgel geheel muzikale verrukking verloren
0.066667, "wees gerust mijnheer de professor gij behoeft u daar zoo bang niet voor te maken"
0.022222, zijne handen bewogen zich de klavieren van zijn instrument waarbij ik opmerkte dat hij alleen de zwarte toetsen aanraakte zoodat de door hem gespeelde bijzonder veel op schotsche geleken weldra hij mijne tegenwoordigheid vergeten en droomerijen verdiept waaruit ik hem niet zocht op te wekken
0.100000, "wat ziet mijnheer dan niet dat die kannibaal ons aanvalt"
0.111111, "neen kapitein maar er bestaat nog een ander gevaar"
0.111111, "zeker mijnheer omdat ons vaartuig evenals de walvisschen ademt"
0.024390, "welnu laat ze komen ik zie geen enkele reden om hun dat te beletten het zijn toch arme duivels die papoea's en ik wil niet dat mijn bezoek de buurt van hun eiland het leven aan een van die ongelukkigen kost"
0.111111, vijf minuten half drie kwam kapitein nemo het salon
0.200000, ik keek hem eens aan
0.166667, "welnu kom dan mede en zie"
0.020408, ondertusschen hadden de ontstelde papoea's de vlucht genomen wij troostten en wreven half lachende den ongelukkigen ned land die vloekte als een bezetene doch op dit oogenblik werd de nautilus door de laatste vloedgolven opgelicht van het rif en dat juist op dezelfde minuut waarop de kapitein het v0.035715, oorspeld de schroef begon langzaam te werken de snelheid nam hand hand toe en aan de oppervlakte van het water blijvende verliet het vaartuig onbeschadigd de gevaarlijke torresstraat
0.019608, den 13den januari kwamen wij de zee van timor en de kapitein verkende het eiland van dien naam op ol dit eiland dat eene oppervlakte heeft van 36000 vierkante kilometer wordt door radjah's bestuurd die vorsten noemen zich zonen van krokodillen dat te zeggen van de hoogste geboorte waarop een sterve0.018868, ling aanspraak kan maken ook wemelt het van die dieren de stroomen van dit eiland waar zij bijzonder vereerd worden men beschermt en vereert ze men bidt ze aan en voedt ze men geeft hun zelfs jonge meisjes ten voedsel en wee den vreemdeling die de hand aan een dier gewijde monsters slaat
0.019231, hoe het ook zij de kapitein deelde mij ook verschillende cijfers mede welke het resultaat waren van zijn onderzoek naar de dichtheid van het water verschillende der aarde eens op een morgen het op den 15den januari wandelde ik met den kapitein op het plat hij vroeg mij ik de verschillende dichtheid0.052632,  van het zeewater kende ik antwoordde ontkennend en voegde er bij dat de wetenschap daarvoor nog geen juiste gegevens
0.500000, "welke kapitein"
0.020408, ik wilde aan den slaap weerstand bieden doch dit onmogelijk mijne ademhaling werd zwakker ik voelde eene kille huivering door mijn loome en als verlamde ledematen mijne oogleden vielen alsof ze van lood waren mijne oogen ik kon ze niet meer oplichten een doffe slaap vol allerlei droombeelden maakte0.071429,  zich van mij meester toen verdwenen mijne visioenen en ik bleef als dood liggen
0.022727, ik voelde hem den pols deze tusschenpoozend het uiteinde zijner ledematen werd reeds koud en ik zag dat de dood naderde zonder dat het mogelijk er iets tegen te doen toen ik den ongelukkigen verbonden en goed gelegd keerde ik mij naar den kapitein
0.020408, ned land en koenraad stonden naast mij wij keken toe en dachten wel dat wij een vreemd schouwspel zouden bijwonen toen ik den grond beschouwde zag ik dat er op regelmatige afstanden kleine verhevenheden lagen welke met stukken kalksteen en koraal bedekt waren hetwelk verried dat dit door menschenha0.500000, nden geschied
0.100000, de kapitein kwam bij mij ik stond op en zeide
0.076924, "uwe dooden sluimeren er ten minste gerust kapitein buiten het bereik der haaien"
0.033333, "dus zult gij met uw makkers" zei kapitein nemo "de oesterbank van manaar bezoeken en indien zich daar toevallig eenig voorbarig visscher ophoudt zult gij hem aan het werk zien"
0.020408, "maar" hernam ik "het weekdier dat bij voorkeur de parel afscheidt de pareloester de kostbare pintadine de parel niets anders dan een samentrekking van parelmoer dat een bolvormige gedaante aanneemt zij hecht zich aan de schelp vast zit verborgen de plooien van het dierlijk lichaam op de schelp zit0.033334,  de parel altijd vast doch het vleesch zij los de kern reeds een klein hard lichaam hetzij een onvruchtbaar eitje een zandkorrel waarom zich jaren lang de parelmoerachtige stof afscheidt"
0.050000, "maar het moet een langdradig en moeilijk werk zijn" zei de amerikaan "om de parels volgens grootte uit te zoeken"
0.055556, "jawel mijn vriend men zegt dat caesar aan servilia een parel aanbood die een waarde van 60000 gulden"
0.050000, "dat waren nagemaakte parels mijn goede ned" zei ik lachende "eenvoudige glazen bolletjes van binnen met een oostersche oplossing overtogen"
0.090909, "waartoe zouden ons zulke schatten aan boord van den nautilus dienen"
0.027778, "kom kom" zei ned land "met een flinken harpoen gij weet mijnheer dat die beesten al heel wonderlijk gevormd zijn ze moeten zich eerst op hun rug keeren voordat ze u kunnen ophappen en dien tijd"
0.333333, "goed" dacht ik
0.142857, "zij zijn reeds gewaarschuwd en wachten ons"
0.021277, de kapitein wees mij met de hand die verbazende opeenstapeling van schelpen en ik begreep dat deze mijn waarlijk onuitputtelijk want de scheppingskracht der natuur grooter dan de verdelgingswoede van den mensch ned land getrouw aan het instinct om te vernietigen haastte zich de grootste schelpen lo0.017857, s te rukken en die een netje te doen dat hij aan den gordel hangen maar wij konden niet stil blijven staan wij moesten den kapitein volgen die langs aan hem alleen bekende paden voortstapte de grond rees weer vrij sterk en soms kon ik mijn arm boven het water uitsteken daarna daalde de bodem nogmaa0.020833, ls soms gingen wij om puntige rotsen heen wier holen en spleten groote schaaldieren op hunne hooge pooten stonden evenals kanonnen op hunne affuiten en ons met starende oogen aankeken voor onzen voet kropen palingen zeeslangen en een soort inktvisschen die hunne voelarmen zoolang als zij konden uit0.017858, ik stom van ontzetting en niet staat mij te bewegen het verslindende dier snelde op den hindoe toe deze sprong op zijde en vermeed daardoor wel den beet van het dier maar geenszins een slag met den staart want hij kreeg een klap tegen de borst en viel op den grond neer dit tooneel duurde nauwelijks0.019231,  eenige seconden de haai kwam terug en zich op den rug wentelend maakte hij zich gereed om zijn slachtoffer te bijten toen ik den kapitein die naast mij zat plotseling voelde opstaan met den dolk de hand trad hij recht op het monster toe en maakte zich gereed om het te bestrijden
0.055556, een glimlach speelde om de bleeke lippen des kapiteins en dit alles "naar den nautilus" beval hij kortaf
0.058824, "hiervoor zijn verschillende uitleggingen mijnheer wilt gij de meening van een kronijkschrijver uit de 14de eeuw weten"
0.030303, "ik geloof mijnheer aronnax dat men die benaming de vertaling zien moet van het hebreeuwsche woord 'edom' en als de ouden haar dien naam gaven het om de bijzondere kleur van het water"
0.027027, op dat oogenblik kwam kapitein nemo op het plat hij zag den dugong begreep de houding van den amerikaan en vroeg hem "als ge een harpoen hadt meester land zou die u dan niet de hand branden"
0.111111, "ik durfde het u niet te vragen" antwoordde ik
0.025000, "waar dat weet ik niet wanneer kan ik ook niet zeggen doch ik veronderstel dat deze reis zal eindigen als de zee ons niets meer leeren kan al wat deze wereld een begin heeft moet noodwendig ook een einde hebben"
0.033333, "ik denk als mijnheer" voegde koenraad er bij "en het zeer licht mogelijk dat na alle van den aardbol doorkruist te hebben de kapitein ons allen drie ons afscheid geeft"
0.030303, ik werd door de logica van ned land het nauw gebracht en ik voelde dat ik op dat punt geslagen werd ik wist niet meer welke bewijsgronden ik voor mijn stelling moest aanvoeren
0.166667, "ik zal dit niet vergeten mijnheer"
0.024390, toen de kapitein dit gezegd ging hij naar een kast dicht bij het linker raam van den salon bij dit meubel zag ik een met ijzer beslagen kist staan op wier deksel een koperen plaat bevestigd met het opschrift "mobilis mobile"
0.100000, "en het kanaal waarin wij ons thans bevinden" vroeg ik
0.038462, "ik zal er nog bijvoegen" hervatte ik "dat er een dergelijke verbinding tusschen gibraltar en ceuta bestaat die een voorwereldlijk tijdperk de middellandsche zee geheel afsloot"
0.019231, ik ging met ned land en koenraad aanstonds naar boven op een afstand van twaalf kilometer zagen wij flauw kaap st vincent het zuidwestelijk uiteinde van het iberische schiereiland de wind woei vrij sterk uit het zuiden de zee stond hol en deed den nautilus sterk slingeren het bijna onmogelijk om op0.019608,  het plat te blijven staan daar groote golven er telkens overheen sloegen wij gingen dus naar beneden na een goeden voorraad versche lucht te hebben ingeademd ik ging naar mijn kamer en koenraad naar zijn hut maar ned land volgde mij met een afgetrokken gelaat onze snelle reis door de middellandsch0.031250, e zee hem niet staat gesteld zijn voornemen ten uitvoer te brengen en hij ontveinsde zijn teleurstelling maar weinig toen hij de deur gesloten ging hij zitten en zag mij zwijgend aan
0.166667, "de zee staat hol" zei ik
0.031250, plotseling sloeg de pendule acht uur de eerste slag wekte mij uit mijn droomen op ik beefde alsof een onzichtbaar oog mijn geheimste gedachte kunnen doorgronden en ik snelde de kamer uit
0.018868, eenige minuten negen hield ik het oor tegen de kamerdeur van den kapitein ik hoorde niets ik verliet de hut en kwam weer den salon die bijna donker en verlaten ik opende de deur van de bibliotheek dezelfde halve duisternis dezelfde eenzaamheid ik ging bij de deur staan die naar de hoofdtrap voerde 0.125000, en wachtte op het teeken van ned land
0.025000, op dit oogenblik verminderden de wentelingen der schroef en hielden eindelijk geheel op waarom dit plaats begunstigde verhinderde dit oponthoud de voornemens van ned land ik wist het niet de stilte werd slechts afgebroken door het kloppen van mijn hart
0.052632, de kapitein strekte zich op den divan uit ik ging werktuigelijk naast hem doch eenigszins meer de schaduw zitten
0.025642, "een maatschappij die van de spaansche regeering concessie heeft gekregen om de gezonken galjoenen op te sporen de aandeelhouders worden uitgelokt door het vooruitzicht van grove voordeelen want men schat de waarde der verzonken schatten op 250 millioen gulden"
0.041667, en toen begreep ik voor wie de millioenen waren bestemd geweest door nemo weggezonden toen de nautilus den omtrek van het opgestane creta dreef
0.500000, hoofdstuk xxxiii
0.111115, "welnu ned het lot ons gisteren niet gunstig geweest"
0.021739, wij hadden geen land meer het gezicht niets dan de oneindige zee eenige zeilen aan den gezichteinder zeker van schepen die tot kaap sanroque varen om een gunstigen wind te zoeken die hen om de kaap de goede hoop voert de hemel bewolkt een storm ophanden
0.018868, ik meende niet goed te hebben verstaan doch kon mijn opmerking niet herhalen omdat het hoofd van den kapitein reeds den helm verdwenen ik zette mijn metalen hoofddeksel op en voelde dat men mij een met ijzer beslagen stok de hand gaf eenige minuten later stonden wij na de gewone verschijnselen op d0.100000, en bodem van den oceaan ter diepte van driehonderd meter
0.020000, onder het voortstappen hoorde ik iets als gekletter boven mijn hoofd soms verdubbelde dit geluid en bracht een onophoudelijk leven voort weldra begreep ik de oorzaak het de regen die den stroom neerviel en op de oppervlakte der zee dit geraas maakte onwillekeurig dacht ik doornat te zullen worden i0.018519, k kon niet nalaten dit dwaze denkbeeld te lachen nat door het water het midden van het water maar tot mijn verontschuldiging voer ik aan dat men met den dikken scaphander aan het lijf het vochtig element niet meer voelt en men zich slechts een weinig dichter atmosfeer dan die van de oppervlakte der0.500000,  aarde waant
0.020000, na een half uur te hebben geloopen werd de grond rotsachtig allerlei kleine dieren verlichtten den bodem door hun lichtgevend vermogen ik zag hoopen steenen die door eenige millioenen diertjes en een net van zeewier bedekt waren dikwijls gleed mijn voet op den gladden bodem uit en zonder mijn stok 0.038462, zou ik meer dan eens gevallen zijn als ik mij omkeerde zag ik altijd het licht van den nautilus dat de verte evenwel begon te verflauwen
0.018868, twee uren na het verlaten van den nautilus hadden wij de uiterste grens der boomen bereikt en honderd voet boven ons verhief zich de top van den berg die donker afstak tegen het helle licht van den anderen kant hier en daar stonden nog eenige versteende struiken duizenden visschen vloden voor ons u0.021277, it evenals vogels het hooge gras verrast de rots doorboord met een menigte ondoordringbare scheuren diepe holen en groote gaten waarin zich verschrikkelijke voorwerpen bewogen ik verstijfde van schrik als ik een spriet voelhoorn zag die mij den weg versperde een vreeselijke schaar welke zich de dui0.022727, sternis der grot met vrij veel geweld opende en sloot duizenden lichtende punten flikkerden dezen nacht het waren de oogen van reusachtige schaaldieren hun schuilplaatsen gedoken van vreeselijke kreeften die als hellebardiers overeind stonden en haar pooten tegen elkander sloegen alsof ze van ijzer0.034483,  waren van reusachtige krabben die als kanonnen op hun affuiten stonden van ontzettende inktvisschen welke met hun voelarmen door elkander werkten als waren ze een broedsel van levende slangen
0.020000, de nacht brak mijn waarnemingen niet af ik alleen gebleven want koenraad naar zijn hut gegaan de nautilus verminderde zijn snelheid en manoeuvreerde door de zee boven den wonderlijk gevormden bodem nu eens streek hij langs de heuvels alsof hij er zich op willen neerleggen dan steeg hij plotseling w0.037037, eer naar de oppervlakte ik zag tusschenbeiden eenige heldere sterren en juist vijf zes van die sterren uit den dierenriem die het sterrenbeeld van orion zichtbaar zijn
0.090909, na het ontbijt omstreeks tien uur gingen wij naar den oever
0.125000, "nu zijn wij weer aan land" zei koenraad
0.020408, weldra moesten wij op een hoogte van omstreeks 250 voet door onoverkomelijke hinderpalen ons klimmen staken de bergwand begon ons heen te hangen en plaats van te stijgen moesten wij onze wandeling om het meer voortzetten op de hoogte waarop wij ons bevonden begon het plantenrijk met het mineraalrij0.021277, k aanraking te komen uit de rotsspleten kwamen hier en daar heesters en op enkele plaatsen zelfs boomen te voorschijn ik herkende eenige planten en bloemen zooals heliotropen en chrysanthemums zelfs ontdekte ik tusschen de lavastroomen kleine doch weinig riekende viooltjes hoewel ik beken dat ik di0.045455, t weinigje geur gretig opsnoof de geur de ziel der bloemen en de bloemen der zee hoe prachtig ook hebben geen ziel
0.023810, de krooszee wordt ook wel sargassozee genoemd naar het spaansche woord "sargazzo" dat zeewier beteekent omdat deze uitgestrekte bank door deze plant gevormd wordt ziehier waarom deze planten volgens den geleerden maury den schrijver van de natuurkundige aardrijksbeschrijving zich vereenigen dit kal0.166667, me gedeelte van den atlantischen oceaan
0.090909, "moet ik u gelooven" vroeg ned terwijl hij een oogje knipte
0.500000, "bijna ned"
0.018519, "toen ik behoefte aan versch vleesch voor mijn manschappen maar hier zou het zijn om het genot te hebben van te moorden ik weet wel dat dit een voorrecht van den mensch maar ik houd niet van dat moorddadig vermaak uws gelijken begaan een laakbare daad meester land met den zuidelijken evenals den no0.021277, ordelijken walvisch zulke goede en weerlooze dieren te vernietigen zoo hebben zij de geheele baffinsbaai reeds ontvolkt en zullen een geheele soort van nuttige dieren uitroeien laat ons dus die arme walvisschen met vrede laten zij hebben reeds genoeg met hunne natuurlijke vijanden de pot zwaard en 0.083333, zaagvisschen te doen zonder dat gij er u mee hoeft te bemoeien"
0.250000, "jawel kapitein" antwoordde ik
0.111111, "welnu wat zegt gij er van ned" vroeg hij
0.019231, den 16den maart echter sloot de ijsmassa ons geheel en al den weg af het de ijsbank nog wel niet doch groote ijsvelden door de koude aan elkander bevestigd deze hinderpaal kon kapitein nemo niet ophouden hij dreef zijn vaartuig met vreeselijke kracht tegen de ijsvlakte de nautilus drong als een wig0.020408,  deze brosse massa en spleet haar met geweldig gekraak van elkander het de oude stormram door een onbeperkte kracht beweging gebracht de stukken ijs werden hoog de lucht geslingerd en vielen als hagelsteenen weer op ons neer alleen door zijn voortstuwende kracht boorde ons vaartuig zich een weg som0.019231, s vloog de nautilus zijn onstuimige vaart op het ijs en verbrijzelde dit dan onder zijn zwaarte dan weer schoot hij er onder doch deed de oppervlakte door er slechts wat tegenaan te stampen vaneen barsten gedurende al die dagen overvielen ons hevige sneeuwvlagen soms mistte het zoo sterk dat men va0.018182, n het eene einde van het plat niet naar het andere kon zien de wind draaide plotseling door alle streken van het kompas de sneeuw vroor zoo hard aan elkaar dat wij die met het houweel vaneen moesten slaan bij een temperatuur van vijf graden onder nul werd de geheele buitenzijde van den nautilus met0.023810,  ijs bedekt op een schip zou men geen enkele manoeuvre hebben kunnen uitvoeren omdat het geheele want vastgevroren zou geweest zijn een vaartuig zonder zeilen door electriciteit beweging gebracht zoodat het geen steenkolen noodig kon ongestraft zich op zulk een breedte wagen
0.026316, eindelijk lag de nautilus den 18den maart na tal van nuttelooze pogingen om verder te komen geheel ingesloten het waren geen ijsvelden ijsklompen meer doch het een eindelooze en onbewegelijke hinderpaal welke uit aan elkander vastgevroren bergen bestond
0.066667, "er overheen mijnheer" antwoordde kapitein nemo bedaard "neen niet er overheen maar er onder door"
0.166667, "er onder door" riep ik uit
0.023810, den volgenden dag 19 maart ging ik om vijf uur 's morgens reeds weder den salon zitten de electrische log wees aan dat de snelheid van den nautilus wat gematigd het vaartuig rees maar zeer voorzichtig de vergaarbakken werden langzaam ledig gepompt
0.020000, ik teekende die verschillende diepten nauwkeurig op en ik kreeg op die wijze als het ware een profiel van dezen onderzeeschen bergketen 's avonds er nog geen enkele verandering onzen toestand gekomen altijd nog ijs op vier vijfhonderd meter beneden de dikte verminderde dus wel wat doch hoe groot di0.100000, e nog tusschen het oppervlak van de zee en ons
0.021277, het strand bezaaid met allerlei soort schelpen hoorns en zeesterren maar de lucht vooral de fauna sterk vertegenwoordigd daar vlogen en fladderden duizenden vogels van allerhande soorten die ons met hun gekras doof schreeuwden anderen zaten groot aantal op de rotsen en lieten ons zonder vrees voorb0.023256, ijgaan zoodat wij ze soms zelfs met den voet aanraakten het waren vetganzen steltloopers groote albatrossen en stormvogels "sommige zoo vet" zei ik tot koenraad "dat de bewoners der ferroeeilanden hun maar een pit het lichaam draaien om die dan aan te steken"
0.019608, nadat wij omstreeks vijf honderd meter waren voortgegaan vonden wij den grond als bezaaid met nesten waaruit zwermen van vogels opvlogen later liet de kapitein er eenige honderden van vangen omdat ze zeer smakelijk om te eten waren die beesten waren zoo weinig schuw dat men ze met steenen kon dood 0.142857, "zijn die dieren niet gevaarlijk" vroeg koenraad
0.022727, twee kilometer verder stuitten wij op een voorgebergte dat de baai tegen den zuidewind beschutte het rees loodrecht uit zee op en het zeeschuim spatte er tegen aan aan de andere zijde der rots hoorden wij een geraas alsof er een troep vee loeide
0.018868, toen wij boven op de rots kwamen zagen wij een groote witte vlakte voor ons vol walrussen de beesten speelden met elkander en brulden van genoegen maar niet van woede zij geleken wel wat op zeekalven maar waren wat grooter hun bovensnijtanden staken uit den bek en waren ongeveer twee en een halven 0.021277, decimeter lang de tanden zijn harder dan die van den olifant en worden minder spoedig geel waarom zij zeer gezocht zijn er wordt dan ook onophoudelijk jacht op gemaakt zoodat ze weldra tot den laatste zullen uitgeroeid zijn althans er worden er jaarlijks meer dan vierduizend gedood
0.250000, "in mijn naam mijnheer"
0.166667, "wat er gaande" vroeg ik aanstonds
0.125000, "dat moet den kapitein gevraagd worden" zei koenraad
0.250000, "is er oogenblikkelijk gevaar"
0.250000, "heeft de nautilus gestooten"
0.083333, "mag ik ook weten kapitein waardoor dit ongeluk veroorzaakt wordt" vroeg ik
0.083333, "kan dan de nautilus niet loskomen als de vergaarbakken leeg worden gepompt"
0.022222, "dat gebeurt op dit oogenblik mijnheer gij kunt de pompen hooren werken kijk maar eens naar den wijzer van den manometer die wijst aan dat de nautilus rijst maar de ijsberg rijst met ons en als niets die rijzing tegenhoudt zal onze stand niet veranderen"
0.058824, "ja zeker wij konden tusschen die ijsblokken verpletterd ten minste vastgekneld zijn en dan zonder versche lucht"
0.018519, "ja voor den drommel" antwoordde ned land "het prachtig maar ik ben woedend dat ik het bekennen moet zoo iets heb ik van mijn leven niet gezien maar dat moois kan ons duur te staan komen want ik geloof dat wij nu dingen zien die god voor het oog der menschen heeft willen verbergen"
0.058824, "mijnheer moet zijn oogen dicht doen en niet kijken" koen hield zelf de handen voor de oogen
0.100000, maar de amerikaan koelde hem wat af door te zeggen
0.058824, "de bewoonde aarde" en schudde het hoofd "wees maar bedaard vriend koen die zullen wij niet weerzien"
0.200000, "dat een oponthoud" zei ik
0.166667, "leest mijnheer daar een belangwekkend boek"
0.018868, voordat hij de muren liet hakken beval hij boringen te doen om den goeden uitslag te verzekeren en te verhaasten er werden diepe gaten de zijmuren gemaakt doch na vijftien meter diep geboord te hebben stiet men nog altijd op den ijsmuur het onnoodig den muur boven ons te onderzoeken omdat zich daar0.018519,  de ijsbank zelf bevond die meer dan vierhonderd meter dik toen liet de kapitein den bodem onderzoeken daar scheidden ons maar tien meter ijs van het water er moest dus een stuk worden uitgehakt dat zoo groot als de doorsnee van ons vaartuig er waren dus 6500 kubieke meter op te ruimen om daardoor 0.066667, een gat te krijgen waardoor wij onder het ijsveld weer het vaarwater zouden kunnen komen
0.020834, die opmerking juist want wie kon berekenen hoeveel tijd wij op zijn minst noodig hadden voor onze bevrijding zouden wij niet gestikt zijn voordat de nautilus weer de oppervlakte kon bereiken het vaartuig bestemd dit ijsgraf te verdwijnen met allen die er waren onze toestand scheen verschrikkelijk m0.047620, aar ieder onzer staarde die toekomst moedig tegen en allen waren vast besloten om ten einde toe hun plicht te doen
0.029413, de kapitein dacht ondertusschen na en stond onbeweeglijk het duidelijk dat een denkbeeld hem door het brein voer maar hij scheen dit weer te verwerpen want hij schudde met het hoofd eindelijk mompelde hij
0.500000, "kokend water"
0.250000, "kokend water" vroeg ik
0.021739, een onbeschrijfelijke zwaarte drukte mij tegen drie uur den namiddag werd ze onuitstaanbaar ik deed niets als vreeselijk gapen mijn borst hijgde naar adem verdooving overviel mij ik lag bijna kracht en bijna wezenloos uitgestrekt mijn brave koen dezelfde gewaarwordingen doch verliet mij niet hij va0.026316, tte mij bij de hand en sprak mij moed ik hoorde hem zelfs mompelen "o als ik maar niet behoefde te ademen om mijnheer meer lucht te geven" de tranen kwamen mij de oogen toen ik dit hoorde
0.027778, het eerste dat ik sprak waren woorden van dankbaarheid jegens mijn makkers ned en koen hadden de laatste uren van dit langdurig lijden mijn leven gerekt al mijn erkentelijkheid kon zulk een opoffering niet genoegzaam vergelden
0.047621, "door hem op te eten" en dit deed hij dienzelfden avond nog maar uit weerwraak want het inderdaad een taaie kost
0.041667, deze vischvangst het einde van ons verbijf die streken van de amazonenrivier en toen de duisternis inviel begaf de nautilus zich weer volle zee
0.076923, "men zal mij nimmer doen gelooven" zei ned land "dat zulke dieren bestaan"
0.027027, "maar ik die tot u spreek" zei koenraad met het ernstigste gezicht van de wereld "herinner mij zeer goed dat ik een groot schip door een voelarm van zulk een koppootig weekdier naar beneden heb zien slepen"
0.125000, "dat dan toch een feit" zei ned land
0.142857, "en hoe lang hij" vroeg de amerikaan
0.022222, het toeval deed ons dit dier ontmoeten en ik wilde de gelegenheid niet laten voorbijgaan om dit staaltje der koppootige weekdieren nauwkeurig te bestudeeren ik overwon het afgrijzen dat mij het gezicht van dit beest inboezemde en begon het met een potlood uit te teekenen
0.125000, "naar boven stijgen en al dat ongedierte vernielen"
0.020409, op dat oogenblik de snelheid van den golfstroom 225 per seconde de stroom te onderscheiden van de omringende zee dat het opeengedrongen water als het ware dat van den oceaan heenstroomt en dat van den golfstroom en het koudere zeewater ongelijk van hoogte bovendien het water donkerkleurig en sterk 0.021739, zouthoudend en steekt door de zuivere indigokleur tegen het omringende groene zeewater bijzonder af de grensscheiding tusschen dit water zoo juist afgebakend dat de nautilus op de hoogte van de carolinen met den voorsteven den golfstroom terwijl de schroef nog de golven van den oceaan doorkliefde
0.062500, "welnu ned wilt gij dat ik aan kapitein nemo vraag welke plannen hij met ons heeft"
0.125000, "een reden te meer hem op te zoeken"
0.041667, "maar ik ben bezig mijnheer ik werk de vrijheid die ik u geef om u af te zonderen mag ik die zelf niet hebben"

0.025641, "mijnheer zal zich wel willen herinneren" zei koenraad toen "dat wij nog al iets van zwemmen kennen hij kan zich op mij verlaten om hem naar dit schip te sturen als hij het goedvindt om vriend ned te volgen"
0.022222, het inderdaad verschrikkelijk als kapitein nemo zooals men wel veronderstellen kon den nautilus gebruikte als een werktuig tot wraakoefening hij ook dien nacht toen hij ons den indischen oceaan onze hut opsloot geen schip aangevallen die op het koralen kerkhof begraven man geen slachtoffer geweest 0.018868, van een schok door den nautilus teweeggebracht ja ik herhaal het zoo moest het zijn een deel van het geheimzinnig leven van kapitein nemo werd daardoor ontsluierd en indien men al niet kon ontdekken wie hij dan vervolgden de tegen hem verbonden niet meer een denkbeeldig wezen maar een man die hun e0.250000, en onverzoenlijken haat gezworen
0.028571, op dit oogenblik raakte een kogel het bekleedsel van den nautilus echter zonder het te beschadigen en sprong dicht bij den kapitein terug zee deze trok de schouders op en zei toen kortaf tegen mij
0.047619, ik wierp een laatsten blik op het schip dat de snelheid vermeerderde daarna ging ik weer naar koenraad en ned land
