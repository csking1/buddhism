0.043479, "het verbazend en ik zie wel kapitein dat gij gelijk gehad hebt om deze kracht te gebruiken welke wind water en stoom vervangt"
0.019608, er nog iets geheimzinnigs doch ik drong er niet op aan om het te weten hoe kon de electriciteit met zulk eene kracht werken waar nam die bijna onbegrensde macht haar oorsprong het door buitengemeene spanning opgewekt door klossen van eene nieuwe soort het door overbrenging van krachten een tot nog 0.047619, toe onbekend stelsel van hefboomen dat men dit electriek vermogen tot het oneindige kon doen toenemen dit kon ik niet begrijpen
0.142857, "zijt gij dan ingenieur kapitein" vroeg ik
0.017857, ik ging naar de middeltrap die tot het plat voerde ik besteeg de metalen treden en door het geopende luik kwam ik boven op de nautilus dit plat stak slechts 80 centimeter uit zee de voor en achtersteven van het vaartuig hadden zulk een vorm dat men het vrij nauwkeurig met een lange sigaar kan verge0.025001, lijken ik bemerkte dat de ijzeren platen even elkander waren geschoven en eenige overeenkomst hadden met de schubben van eenig kruipend dier ik begreep dus vrij natuurlijk dat dit schip niettegenstaande de beste kijkers altijd voor een zeemonster gehouden werd
0.018519, de kapitein groette mij ik bleef met mijne gedachten ik dacht slechts aan den kapitein van de nautilus zou ik ooit te weten komen tot welke natie deze vreemdsoortige man behoorde die er zich op beroemde tot geene te behooren wie dien haat bij hem opgewekt welken hij aan de menschheid gezworen en di0.023810, e hem misschien op vreeslijke wraak bedacht deed zijn het een van die miskende geleerden dien men volgens eene uitdrukking van koenraad "verdriet aangedaan" een nieuwerwetsche galilei een van die wetenschappelijke mannen zooals de amerikaan maury wiens loopbaan door staatkundige omwentelingen afgeb0.026316, roken ik kon het niet zeggen hij ontving mij dien het toeval bij hem aan boord gebracht mij wiens leven zijne hand lag koel doch gastvrij hij evenwel nimmer mijne hem toegestoken hand aangevat mij de zijne toegestoken

0.023256, "wat zou dat heb ik dan niet het toestel van rouquayrol ik heb slechts een buis aan te schroeven en een kraan open te maken bovendien mijnheer aronnax zult gij zien dat men bij die onderzeesche jachtpartijen weinig lucht en kogels noodig heeft"
0.066667, "maar mijn beste ned" zeide ik hem "de bosschen van crespo zijn slechts onderzeesche bosschen"
0.020833, op dit oogenblik daalde de bodem vrij snel het licht verminderde wij bereikten eene diepte van honderd meter en liepen onder eene drukking van tien atmosferen doch mijne kleeding zoo gemaakt dat ik van die drukking niets gevoelde alleen bemerkte ik zekere belemmering het gebruik mijner vingers doch0.027027,  dit verdween spoedig en hoewel ik vermoeid moest zijn van eene wandeling van twee uur eene kleeding waaraan ik weinig gewoon gevoelde ik daarvan bijna niets door het water geholpen kon ik mij met bijzonder gemak bewegen
0.058824, terwijl kapitein nemo zoo sprak veranderde hij geheel van gelaat en wekte mij eene buitengewone ontroering op
0.020834, "daar" voegde hij er nog bij "is het ware leven ik zou haast kunnen droomen van de stichting van zeesteden verzamelingen van onderzeesche huizen die even als de nautilus elken morgen aan de oppervlakte der zee versche lucht zouden komen inademen vrije onafhankelijke steden zooals er nergens gevonde0.111111, n worden en nog wie weet niet eenig tiran"
0.019608, koenraad en land brachten een groot deel van den tijd met mij door koenraad aan zijn vriend wonderen van onze wandeling verteld en deze er nu spijt van dat hij ons niet vergezeld maar ik hoopte dat de gelegenheid zich nog wel eens zou voordoen om die onderzeesche bosschen te bezoeken
0.018868, de harpoenier bedroog zich niet wij hadden een schip voor ons welks gescheurd want er nog bij hing de romp scheen goeden staat te zijn en de schipbreuk kon slechts eenige uren geleden hebben plaats gehad drie stompen van masten welke twee voet boven het dek waren afgehouwen toonden aan dat het door0.020834,  storm beloopen schip zijn staand want moeten opofferen doch op zijde geslagen het volgeloopen en gezonken het helde aan bakboordzijde nog het een treurig schouwspel dat wrak daar onder water te zien drijven maar nog treuriger te aanschouwen hoe eenige lijken op het dek met touwen vastgesjord lagen0.018182,  ik telde er vijf vier mannen van wie een nog aan het roer stond en verder eene vrouw welke halfweg uit de kajuitskap met een kind den arm te voorschijn kwam de vrouw nog jong door het licht van de nautilus beschenen kon ik duidelijk hare trekken onderscheiden welke het water nog niet onkenbaar gem0.020408, aakt bij eene laatste stuiptrekking zij haar kind nog opgeheven doch het arme kleine wicht hield de armpjes om den hals der moeder geslagen de houding der vier matrozen vreeselijk verwrongen als zij waren door stuiptrekkende bewegingen terwijl zij eene laatste poging hadden gedaan om zich van de ko0.019231, orden waarmede zij aan het schip gebonden waren te ontdoen slechts de stuurman zag er kalmer uit zijn gelaat ernstig de grijze haren zaten hem tegen de slapen geplakt en met de hand aan het roerrad geklemd scheen hij zijnen verongelukten driemaster nog door de diepten van den oceaan te willen sture0.020408, n welk een tooneel wij waren verstomd ons hart klopte hoorbaar bij het gezicht van die als 't ware op heeter daad betrapte schipbreuk welke om zoo te zeggen hare laatste oogenblikken gephotographeerd ik zag reeds vreeselijk groote haaien met vurig oog naderen zeker aangelokt door die lekkernij van 0.045455, menschenvleesch de nautilus maakte eene wending en draaide om het gezonken schip heen zoodat ik een oogenblik op den spiegel lezen kon

0.062500, "zoudt gij mij dan kunnen vertellen wat iedereen weet" vroeg hij mij op eenigszins spotachtigen toon
0.025000, den nacht van 27 op 28 december verliet de nautilus de kusten van vanikoro met buitengewone snelheid zij richtte zich naar het zuidwesten en drie dagen doorliepen wij de 750 kilometer welke dit eiland van de zuidoostpunt van nieuwguinea scheidt
0.200000, "neen een toeval" zijn antwoord
0.025641, "mijnheer heeft gelijk" antwoordde koenraad "en ik stel voor om ons vaartuig drie plaatsen open te houden eene voor vruchten eene voor groenten en eene voor wild hoewel ik van dit laatste nog het minste geringste niet gezien heb"
0.111111, "wij moeten voor den nacht terug zijn" zeide ik
0.076923, "maar er zijn er toch bij die men eten kan" antwoordde de harpoenier
0.250000, "paradijsvogels" riep ik uit
0.142857, "orde der musschen afdeeling der" antwoordde koenraad

0.021740, "goed koen ik stem u toe dat het eerlijke menscheneters zijn en dat zij hunne gevangenen fatsoenlijk opeten maar daar ik zelfs niet eens fatsoenlijk wil opgegeten worden zal ik oppassen want de kapitein schijnt geen de minste voorzorgen te nemen en nu aan 't werk"

0.066667, "morgen ochtend moet gij het luik weder openen om de lucht de nautilus te ververschen"
0.041667, "maar als op dat oogenblik de papoea's op het plat zijn dan zie ik niet hoe gij ze beletten zult om binnen te komen"
0.019231, "gij hebt gelijk mijnheer" zeide hij na eenige oogenblikken gezwegen te hebben "het eene wereld op zich zelf mijn vaartuig voor de aarde hetzelfde als de planeten welke haar om de zon vergezellen men zal immers de werken der geleerden die op saturnus jupiter leven ook nooit op aarde leeren kennen o0.052632, mdat het toeval ons bij elkander gebracht heeft kan ik u den uitslag van mijn onderzoek echter wel mededeelen"
0.021277, ik keerde mij om kapitein nemo stond voor mij doch ik herkende hem niet zijn gelaat geheel veranderd zijn oog schitterde met doffen glans en onder de samengetrokken wenkbrauwen bijna onzichtbaar zijne geopende lippen lieten de op elkander geperste tanden gedeeltelijk zien hij stond recht overeind m0.021277, et gebalde vuisten en opgetrokken schouders zijn geheele persoon teekende vreeselijken haat hij stond onbeweeglijk hij mijn kijker aan zijne voeten laten vallen ik zonder het te willen dien toorn opgewekt meende die ondoorgrondelijke man dat ik eenig geheim doorgrond hetwelk voor de gasten van de n0.020000, autilus verborgen moest blijven neen ik het voorwerp niet van dien haat want hij keek mij niet aan maar hield het oog gevestigd op het voor mij onzichtbare punt aan den gezichteinder eindelijk werd kapitein nemo zich zelven weer meester zijn gelaat dat zoo vreeselijk veranderd hernam zijne gewone k0.058824, alme uitdrukking hij zeide eenige woorden vreemde taal tegen zijn stuurman en wendde zich toen tot mij
0.083333, "ongelukkig" zeide ned land "heeft men ons slechts de gewone scheepskost voorgezet"
0.076923, "mijnheer aronnax" zeide de kapitein "zoudt gij een van mijne manschappen willen behandelen"
0.047619, den volgenden morgen ging ik op het plat de kapitein er reeds toen hij mij zag kwam hij naar mij toe
0.250003, "als zij lust hebben"
0.021739, ik voor mij vergenoegde mij niet meer met de door koenraad gemaakte veronderstellingen de brave jongen zag den gezagvoerder van den nautilus slechts een van die miskende geleerden die de menschheid enkel met verachting voor haar onverschilligheid betalen hij beschouwde hem nog als een onbegrepen ve0.037037, rnuft dat het bedrog der wereld moede naar die ontoegankelijke oorden gevlucht waar zijn vernuft vrije speling volgens mijn meening verklaarde die veronderstelling slechts van nemo's karaktertrekken
0.031250, de visschen wekten voortdurend onze bewondering als wij de geheimen van hun leven door de geopende wanden van den salon bespiedden ik zag verscheiden soorten die ik tot nog toe niet opgemerkt

0.040000, koenraad kon zijn oogen niet gelooven en vroeg mij wat de oorzaak van dit zonderling verschijnsel zijn kon gelukkig kon ik hem van antwoord dienen
0.018868, ik ging de bibliotheek om er een werk dit eiland te halen dat als een van de vruchtbaarste der wereld beschouwd wordt ik vond een bock ceylon cingales getiteld toen ik den salon kwam keek ik eerst de ligging van ceylon na waaraan de ouden zooveel verschillende namen gegeven hebben het ligt tusschen0.031250,  55' en 49' nb en 42' en 5' ol van greenwich het 275 kilometer lang 150 breed en 900 omtrek de oppervlakte beslaat 24448 vierkante kilometer het dus iets kleiner dan ierland

0.019231, als men u uitnoodigde om de zwitsersche bergen op de berenjacht te gaan zoudt gij zeggen "goed morgen zullen wij op de beren jacht maken" als iemand u een uitnoodiging zond om de noordafrikaansche vlakte op leeuwen jacht te maken zoudt gij antwoorden "zoo het schijnt dat wij op leeuwen tijgers gaan0.031250,  jagen" maar wanneer men u op die wijze verzocht om de haaien hun natuurlijk element na te jagen zoudt gij er misschien nog wel eens willen nadenken voordat gij die uitnoodiging aannaamt
0.058824, "over de visscherij" antwoordde ned land "het goed het terrein te kennen men er zich op waagt"
0.076923, ned en koen namen plaats op een rustbank waarna de eerste mij vroeg
0.083333, "daarom heeft kaatje misschien een ander getrouwd" antwoordde ned land zeer wijsgeerig
0.050000, "wie zegt ons" riep ned land uit "dat wij er morgen op onze wandeling ook niet zulk een zullen vinden"
0.062500, "ik" riep de amerikaan "en harpoenier van professie het mijn ambacht om die uit te lachen"
0.062500, ned land sprak van dat "ophappen" op een manier die mij een rilling het lijf joeg
0.166667, "ik" zei koenraad "zal openhartig spreken"
0.200000, de kapitein wachtte mij reeds
0.026316, "geweren waartoe zouden die dienen vallen de bergbewoners den beer niet aan met den dolk de hand en het staal niet zekerder dan het lood hier een stevig lemmet steek het uw gordel en laat ons zee gaan"
0.142857, "ik dank u ned land" zei hij
0.066667, "wij gaan daarheen waar de luimen van den kapitein ons voeren willen ned" zei ik
0.021277, daarop naderde de nautilus de afrikaansche kust waar de diepte der zee veel grooter daar konden wij het kristalhelder water door de ruiten van den salon die prachtige struiken van schitterende koralen en de uitgestrekte rotswanden beschouwen waarop een heerlijk schoon tapijt van zeewier en andere z0.021739, eeplanten uitgespreid welk een onbeschrijfelijk schouwspel en welk een verscheidenheid van vormen en kleuren langs die klippen en vulkanische eilandjes die de lybische kust omzoomen doch die flora verscheen al hare schoonheid langs de oostkust waar de nautilus weldra heenging het op de kust van teh0.019231, ema want toen zagen wij die verscheidenheid van planten niet alleen onder het vlak der zee maar zij slingerden zich zelfs tot op tien voet hoogte ook daar boven elkander de laatsten waren grilliger van vorm doch minder kleurig dan de eersten omdat de voedingkracht van het water de frischheid der kl0.250000, euren waarschijnlijk meer bevorderde
0.023810, hoeveel aangename uren bracht ik voor de ramen van den salon door hoeveel nieuwe voorwerpen uit de onderzeesche dieren en plantenwereld bewonderde ik niet den schijn van ons electrisch licht paddenstoelvormige sponzen leigrijze kliprozen onder anderen de thalassiantus aster (bloeiende zeeasters) kr0.027778, iskoralen als fluiten slechts wachtende op den adem van pan schulpen die men elders niet aantreft uitloopende korte spiralen en vastzittende holligheden van sterkoralen en eindelijk bij duizenden de gewone spons die ik nog niet opgemerkt
0.023810, "dat duidelijk" antwoordde ik "en het voor de oudheidkenners te hopen dat men vroeg laat die opgravingen zal beginnen wanneer na de doorgraving der landengte van suez hier nieuwe steden zullen verrijzen voor vaartuigen als de nautilus het een zeer ondoelmatig kanaal"
0.111111, "nu gaan wij den doorgang zoeken" zei kapitein nemo
0.019231, kwart tienen nam de kapitein zelf het stuurrad handen een breede donkere en diepe galerij opende zich voor ons de nautilus liep die stoutmoedig binnen ik hoorde langs de wanden van het schip een ongewoon geraas het het water van de roode zee dat door den hellenden tunnel naar de middellandsche zee 0.052632, stroomde de nautilus volgde pijlsnel dien stroom niettegenstaande de inspanning der machine die de schroef omgekeerde richting deed werken
0.026316, op de muren van den nauwen doorgang zag ik niets dan schitterende en vurige strepen door het electrisch licht en de snelheid van de vaart voortgebracht mijn hart klopte hevig ik hield de handen tegen de borst gedrukt
0.058824, "vijf minuten half elf gaf de kapitein het stuurrad weer en zich naar mij wendend zei hij
0.333333, "de middellandsche zee"
0.062500, minder dan twintig minuten de nautilus door den stroom medegesleept onder de landengte van suez doorgevaren
0.111111, "vertel dat aan anderen mijnheer" zei de stijfhoofdige amerikaan
0.333333, ik antwoordde niet
0.062500, "welnu ik denk (ik zeg niet ik hoop) dat deze gunstige gelegenheid zich nimmer zal voordoen"
0.027027, "en nu ned" voegde ik er bij "zullen wij verder er zwijgen geen woord meer er den dag waarop je gereed zult zijn zul je ons waarschuwen en wij volgen je ik verlaat mij geheel op je"
0.028571, zoo wist ik niet anders dat wij het eiland carpathos een van de sporaden langs voeren dan door het vers van virgilius dat kapitein nemo aanhaalde toen hij met den vinger op de kaart wees
0.083333, "och mijnheer die warmte zal niet vermeerderen als wij het niet willen"
0.030303, "bij het eiland santorino mijnheer de professor" antwoordde de kapitein "en juist het kanaal dat neakameni van paleakameni scheidt ik heb u het zonderling schouwspel van een onderzeesche vulkanische uitbarsting willen doen zien"
0.166667, door de middellandsche zee twee dagen
0.021739, toen wij tusschen en tunis doorvoeren verminderde de nautilus zijn snelheid deze ruimte tusschen kaap bon en de westpunt van stijgt de bodem der zee bijna plotseling daar een wezenlijke bergkam waarboven slechts zeventien meter water staan terwijl de diepte aan weerszijden zeventig meter bedraagt d0.031250, e nautilus moest dus zeer voorzichtig varen om niet tegen dien onderzeeschen rotswand te stooten ik wees koenraad op een kaart van de middellandsche zee de plaats van dezen langen rotswand aan
0.035714, "welnu mijn vriend eens zal de aarde een kil lijk worden zij zal onbewoonbaar en onbewoond zijn als de maan die haar levenskracht sedert langen tijd verloren heeft"
0.500000, hoofdstuk xxxii
0.029412, toen wij de straat van gibraltar door waren de nautilus het ruime sop gekozen hij rees naar de oppervlakte waardoor wij dus de gelegenheid werden gesteld onze dagelijksche wandelingen op het plat te vervolgen
0.018182, ik den kapitein sedert ons bezoek aan het eiland santorino niet terug gezien zou het toeval ons voor mijn vertrek nog bij elkander brengen ik begeerde en ik vreesde het te gelijk ik luisterde ik hem niet zijn hut naast de mijne hoorde loopen doch geen geluid trof mijn oor zijn hut moest ledig zijn
0.017544, "nutteloos" antwoordde hij terwijl hij vuur geraakte "gelooft gij dan mijnheer dat die rijkdommen verloren zijn nu ik ze verzamel het volgens uw oordeel voor mij dat ik mij de moeite geef die schatten op te rapen wie zegt u dat ik er geen goed gebruik van maak gelooft gij dan dat ik niet weet dat e0.037037, r een lijdende menschheid bestaat dat er slaafs onderdrukte volken op deze aarde leven dat er ongelukkigen geholpen slachtoffers gewroken moeten worden begrijpt gij mij niet "
0.047619, den volgenden dag 19 februari zag ik den amerikaan mijn kamer komen ik verwachtte hem hij zag er zeer teleurgesteld uit
0.500000, onderzeesche kolenmijnen
0.040000, "wacht maar eenige oogenblikken onze lantaarn wordt aangestoken en als gij er op gesteld zijt helder voor u uit te zien zult gij tevreden zijn"
0.019608, "neen mijnheer maar hij heeft electriciteit noodig om zich te bewegen elementen om deze voort te brengen sodium om de elementen te voeden kool om sodium te krijgen en mijnen om steenkolen uit te halen en nu het juist hier dat de zee geheele bosschen bedekt die voorwereldlijke tijdperken zijn bedolv0.076923, en geraakt nu zijn zij geheel verkoold en voor mij een onuitputtelijke bron"
0.032258, ik naderde en moest mij gewonnen geven een gat van een drakenboom waren eenige duizenden van de vernuftige insecten die op de canarische eilanden zooveel voorkomen en wier honig zoo gezocht
0.047619, "als ik den honig met het deeg van den broodboom vermeng" zei hij "dan kan ik u een kostelijken koek aanbieden"
0.018868, tot op 13 maart ging onze tocht op dezelfde wijze voort dien dag werd de nautilus gebezigd om proeven van peiling te doen welke mij het grootste belang inboezemden sedert ons vertrek uit de stille zuidzee hadden wij ongeveer 52000 kilometer afgelegd wij waren nu op 37' zb 53' wl het omstreeks dezel0.019608, fde plaats waar kapitein denham van de herald op 14000 meter geen grond vond daar luitenant parker van het amerikaansche fregat congres op 15140 meter den bodem niet kunnen peilen kapitein nemo besloot om den nautilus naar de grootste diepte te doen dalen om die verschillende peilingen eens na te g0.018868, aan ik maakte mij gereed den uitslag van dit onderzoek op te teekenen de zaalwanden openden zich en het vaartuig begon zich beweging te stellen ten einde die verbazende diepte te kunnen bereiken men kan nagaan dat er geen sprake kon zijn van door middel van het vullen der vergaderbakken naar den af0.019608, grond te zinken misschien zou dat water de specifieke zwaarte van den nautilus toch niet genoeg hebben kunnen vermeerderen bovendien zou men om weer te stijgen het water moeten uitpompen en dan zouden zeer zeker de pompen niet krachtig genoeg geweest zijn om den druk van buiten te overwinnen de kap0.025641, itein besloot dus om de zwaarden vleugels van zijn nautilus een hoek van te plaatsen en aldus schuins naar beneden te varen de schroef kreeg bovendien de grootste snelheid van beweging en draaide met onbeschrijfelijke kracht door het water
0.020409, wij zaten op het plat de zee kalm want de octobermaand schonk ons op deze hemelbreedte nog eenige schoone herfstdagen de amerikaan bespeurde aan den gezichteinder een walvisch en hij kon zich daarin niet bedriegen als men goed toekeek zag men den zwarten rug beurtelings verschijnen en verdwijnen op0.166667,  ongeveer vijf kilometer van den nautilus
0.083333, "een reden te meer om er kennis mede te maken" antwoordde koenraad
0.100001, "dat heb ik met eigen oogen gezien" zei de amerikaan
0.111111, de amerikaan keerde zich bij deze woorden driftig om
0.050000, "gij zijt daar zeker van ned" antwoordde ik "doch ik niet daarom juist zou ik het wel eens willen onderzoeken"
0.037037, ik erken dat ned land gelijk en zoolang er geen schepen gebouwd worden om die ijsvelden te varen zullen wij wel altijd voor die ijsbank blijven steken
0.043478, enkele het mogelijk dat als er aan de zuidpool een zee deze geheel bevroren en wij derhalve niet aan de oppervlakte kunnen komen"
0.022222, hij verloor echter geen oogenblik op een gegeven teeken verscheen de eerste stuurman de twee mannen spraken eenige oogenblikken met elkander hun onbegrijpelijke taal en hetzij de stuurman reeds vooruit gewaarschuwd hetzij hij het plan voor uitvoerbaar hield hij liet geen de minste verwondering blij0.071429, "ik weet het niet" antwoordde hij "om twaalf uur zullen wij eens hoogte nemen"
0.058824, "maar de zon zal door dien mist niet heendringen" zei ik terwijl ik de grauwe lucht bekeek
0.022727, de bodem met roodachtig zand als met fijn gestampte tichelsteenen bedekt daartusschen zagen wij stukken lava puimsteen en andere vulkanische producten op sommige plaatsen stegen lichte rookwolkjes die een sterken zwaveldamp verbreidden uit den grond en deden dus zien dat het onderaardsche vuur nog 0.023810, al zijn kracht behouden toen wij evenwel op een hooge rots gekomen waren zag ik verscheiden kilometer de rondte geen enkelen vulkaan men zal zich herinneren dat kapitein ross deze streken op 32' breedte de vulkanen erebus en terror volle werking zag
0.037037, "neen" antwoordde ik "behalve als men ze aanvalt als een zeekalf zijn jong verdedigt het beest woedend en het niet zelden gebeurd dat het een sloep verbrijzelt"
0.166667, "het dier heeft gelijk" zei koen
0.020000, de kapitein keerde naar boord terug koenraad en ik bleven tot vijf uur aan land om te ontdekken en ons te oefenen ik kreeg geen enkel merkwaardig voorwerp handen behalve het bijzonder groot ei van een vetgans waarvoor een liefhebber misschien vijfhonderd gulden zou betaald hebben het ei van isabell0.019608, akleur en zeldzaam door de streepjes en figuurtjes die er als hieroglyphen op stonden ik gaf het aan koenraad en deze bracht het met de noodige voorzichtigheid ongeschonden aan boord ik legde dit zeldzame ei onder een van de glasramen den salon daarna soupeerde ik met een heerlijk stukje lever van 0.034483, een zeekalf dat wel wat naar varkensvleesch smaakte toen ik naar bed ging deed ik als de hindoes en riep voor den volgenden dag de gunsten van de zon
0.022727, kapitein nemo bekeek met een kijker die door middel van spiegels de straalbreking verbeterde het hemellichaam dat zeer schuine richting langzamerhand onder den gezichteinder wegzonk ik den chronometer de hand mijn hart klopte hevig indien het verdwijnen van de benedenste helft der schijf samenviel 0.076923, met het twaalfde uur op den chronometer dan waren wij aan de pool
0.250000, "twaalf uur" riep ik
0.250000, "in wiens naam kapitein"
0.032258, "duizend duivels" bromde de amerikaan "ik weet het wel de nautilus gestrand en nu geloof ik niet dat de kast zich er uit zal redden zooals de eerste keer de torresstraat"
0.040000, "dat kunnen wij gemakkelijk zien" en naar den manometer gaande zag ik tot mijn groote verbazing dat wij op een diepte van 360 meter lagen
0.058824, het oogenblik zonderling gekozen om zich aan wijsgeerige bespiegelingen te geven het antwoord verklaarde mij bovendien niets
0.142868, "ja ja wij zijn er best afgekomen"
0.200000, "ik ben blind" riep hij
0.050000, "blijft hier vrienden" zei ik terwijl ik hen tegenhield "wij moeten bij elkander blijven totdat wij uit den tunnel zijn"
0.250000, "zijn wij dus ingesloten"
0.500000, hoofdstuk xl
0.076923, "wij zullen het tenminste beproeven door den muur te doorboren die ons insluit"
0.071429, "vrienden" zei ik "de toestand ernstig doch ik reken op uw moed en geestkracht"
0.047619, "ik geloof het wel" antwoordde hij "wij zullen niet verpletterd worden wij hebben dus alleen nog maar voor verstikking te vreezen"
0.020408, dien dag werd het werk met nog grooter kracht voortgezet er moesten nog maar twee meter worden losgehakt slechts twee meter scheidden ons van de open zee maar de vergaarbakken waren bijna leeg het weinigje lucht dat er nog moest voor het werkvolk bewaard blijven niets voor den nautilus
0.029412, ned land sprak niet maar hij opende zijn mond zoo wijd dat de haaien er zelfs bang voor zouden geworden zijn en welk een ademhaling de amerikaan "trok" als een kachel die fel brandde
0.111111, "en gij mijn brave koen hebt gij veel geleden"
0.500000, de inktvisschen
0.100000, "ja vriend ned het een schilderij waarop de inktvisch afgebeeld"
0.071429, "dan zitten wij ieder geval toch niet vast" zei de amerikaan "want wij drijven"
0.166667, ik trad op den kapitein toe
0.021739, de nautilus ondertusschen aan de oppervlakte der zee gekomen een der matrozen stond op de bovenste trede en maakte de schroeven van het luik los maar deze waren ternauwernood los het luik sprong met vreeselijk geweld open zeker door de voelarmen van een der inktvisschen opengerukt
0.019608, de oorspong van den golfstroom door maury ontdekt de golf van gascogne daar vormt hij zich hoewel er dan nog weinig verschil warmtegraad en kleur bestaat hij wendt zich naar het zuiden gaat langs de westkust van afrika ziet zijn golven door de stralen der zon de verzengde luchtstreek verwarmen stro0.019231, omt dan door den atlantischen oceaan bereikt kaap roque op de kust van en verdeeld zich dan twee takken waarvan de een het warme water van de zee der antillen opneemt dan begint de golfstroom zijn rol te spelen door het evenwicht te herstellen tusschen de verschillende temperaturen en het water van0.020408,  de heele luchtstreek aanraking te brengen met het water der koudere streken verhit de golf van mexico stroomt hij noordwaarts langs de kust van noordamerika naar newfoundland en wijkt dan oostwaarts af door toedoen van den kouden stroom die uit de davisstraat komt daarna gaat de golfstroom door de0.020833, n oceaan langs een loxodromische lijn verdeelt zich om streeks nb twee takken waarvan de een door toedoen van den noordoostpassaat naar de golf van gascogne en de azoren terugkeert en de ander de luchtgesteldheid op de kusten van ierland en noorwegen verzacht zelfs tot spitsbergen doorstroomt waar 0.066669, de temperatuur van het water tot vier graden daalt en dan de open poolzee vormt
0.200000, "ik zal hem ondervragen ned"
0.020000, "hier ligt een handschrift verscheiden talen mijnheer aronnax het behelst het overzicht van mijn de zee en zoo god wil zal het niet met mij te gronde gaan dit handschrift door mij onderteekend en aangevuld met de geschiedenis van mijn leven zal een hermetisch gesloten kistje worden geborgen de laat0.041667, st overlevende van ons aan boord van den nautilus zal het zee werpen en dan kan het gaan waarheen de golven het voeren willen"
0.017857, "mijnheer" zei ik "het zou noch uwen noch mijnen smaak vallen om voor de tweede maal op dit onderwerp terug te komen maar omdat wij er nu eenmal mee bezig zijn kunnen wij het ten einde toe behandelen ik herhaal u dat hier niet alleen sprake van mijn persoon voor mij studie een hulpmiddel een kracht0.018868, ige afleiding een wegslepend iets een hartstocht die mij alles doet vergeten evenals gij ben ik iemand die gaarne eenzaam en vergeten leef de geringe verwachting van eens aan het nageslacht de vruchten mijner na te laten door middel van een kistje dat ik aan de gril van golven en wind zou toevertro0.020408, uwen woord ik kan u bewonderen en zonder verdriet volgen een rol die ik slechts sommige opzichten begrijp maar uw leven heeft nog andere gezichtspunten waardoor ik het beschouw als omringd van moeielijkheden en geheimzinnigheden waarmede mijn makkers en ik niets te maken hebben en zelfs als ons har0.020000, t voor u heeft kunnen kloppen bewogen als het door innige droefheid getroffen door grootsche moedige daden hebben wij zelfs het geringste bewijs van dit medegevoel ons hart moeten terugdringen een medegevoel dat het gezicht van het schoone en goede ons opwekt hetzij dit komt van een vriend van een 0.019231, vijand welnu het dit gevoel dat wij vreemd zijn aan al wat u betreft dat onze toestand hier onhoudbaar en onmogelijk maakt zelfs voor mij maar vooral onmogelijk voor ned land ieder mensch waard dat men aan hem denkt alleen omdat hij mensch hebt gij u zelven wel afgevraagd welke wraakzuchtige planne0.041667, n zucht naar vrijheid en afschuw van slavernij een karakter als dat van den amerikaan kunnen doen rijpen wat hij kan denken pogen beproeven"
0.200000, 24' nb en 28' ol
0.022222, den 10den mei waren wij tegenover de zuidelijkste punt van newfoundland de zich daar bevindende zandbank bestaat uit een opeenstapeling van allerlei aanslibsel van de zee uit een verzameling van de organische bestanddeelen welke door den golfstroom van den evenaar door den koudwaterstroom die langs0.031250,  de amerikaansche kust gaat van de noordpool worden aangevoerd daar stapelden zich ook die groote zwerfblokken op door de ijsschollen meegesleept het groote knekelhuis van visschen weekdieren welke er met millioenen omkomen
0.021277, onder de massa visschen die wij dichte drommen voorbij de ramen zagen zwemmen trokken vooral de kabeljauwen onze aandacht die zich bij voorkeur op de zandbanken van newfoundland ophouden men kan dezen kabeljauw den bergvisch noemen want newfoundland niets anders dan een onderzeesche berg toen de na0.033333, utilus door de dichte scholen van die dieren heenstoof kon koenraad de volgende opmerking niet voor zich houden "wat kabeljauwen ik dacht dat ze zoo plat waren als bot tong"
0.040001, "vriend ned" zei koenraad "wat kan het den nautilus voor kwaad doen zal dat schip ons onder water aanvallen zal het ons onder zee beschieten"
0.021740, ondertusschen regende het kogels rondom ons eenige troffen slechts even de oppervlakte der zee en sprongen dan op opzettenden afstand weg maar geen enkele trof den nautilus het gepantserde vaartuig nog maar drie kilometer van ons af niettegenstaande het hevig kanonvuur verscheen de kapitein niet op0.041667,  het plat en als toch een van die kegelvormige kogels den nautilus vlak op een der platen getroffen zou dit noodlottig hebben kunnen worden
0.019231, een gedeelte van den nacht ging voorbij zonder dat er iets voorviel wij loerden op een gelegenheid om ons plan te volbrengen wij spraken weinig want wij waren te ontroerd ned land wel zee willen springen ik dwong hem te wachten volgens mijn gevoelen zou de nautilus den tweedekker op de oppervlakte 0.019231, aanvallen en dan ware het niet alleen mogelijk maar zelf gemakkelijk om te vluchten om drie uur 's morgens ging ik vol ongerustheid naar het plat kapitein nemo het niet verlaten hij stond overeind voorop bij zijn vlag welke een zacht koeltje boven zijn hoofd deed wapperen hij verloor het schip niet0.018519,  uit het oog zijn buitengewoon scherpe blik scheen het aan te trekken te begoochelen en zekerder met zich mee te sleepen dan dat hij het op sleeptouw de maan toen op haar grootste hoogte jupiter kwam het oosten op te midden van die stille natuur wedijverden lucht en zee kalmte en de nachtvorstin li0.021739, et haar stralen schitteren den schoonsten spiegel waarin hare stralen ooit weerkaatst hadden en als ik dacht aan deze kalmte der elementen en deze vergeleek met al den hartstocht en gramschap die den onbegrijpelijken nautilus waren opgesloten dan voelde ik een rilling door mijn leden gaan
0.166667, de laatste woorden van kapitein nemo
0.021277, de ramen waren dichtgeschoven maar het licht scheen niet weer den salon het binnenste van den nautilus heerschte stilte en duisternis wij verlieten deze vreeselijke plek op honderd meter onder water met een verbazende snelheid waar gingen wij heen naar het noorden naar het zuiden waarheen vluchtte 0.100003, die man na zulk een vreeselijke wraak te hebben genomen
0.023810, "de zee staat hol het waait hard maar ik ben niet bang om twintig kilometer de kleine sloep van den nautilus af te leggen zonder dat de bemanning het gemerkt heeft heb ik er eenige levensmiddelen en een paar flesschen water verborgen"
0.023256, daarom ging de amerikaan de deur uit zonder mij tijd te gunnen om te antwoorden ik wilde eens zien welke richting de nautilus voer en ging naar den salon wij liepen met verbazende snelheid naar het noordnoordoosten op een diepte van vijftig meter
0.020000, op dat oogenblik hoorde ik de akkoorden van een orgel een treurige harmonie als de droeve klacht eener ziel die haar aardsche kluisters wil verbreken ik luisterde zoo scherp mogelijk toe haalde nauwelijks adem en evenals kapitein nemo weldra een muzikale verrukking die ons de wereld met al wat haar0.020408,  aankleeft doet vergeten daarna ontstelde ik door een plotseling invallende gedachte kapitein nemo zijn kamer verlaten hij den salon waar ik doorheen moest om te vluchten daar zou ik hem dus een laatste maal ontmoeten hij zou mij zien en misschien toespreken een beweging van hem kon mij vernietigen0.142857,  een enkel woord mij aan boord kluisteren
