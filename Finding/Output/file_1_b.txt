0.021277, ik boog ten teeken van toestemming het geene vraag welke hij mij deed derhalve er ook geen antwoord noodig die man sprak met eene bijzondere gemakkelijkheid zonder eenig merkbaar accent zijne volzinnen waren afgerond zijne woorden juist gekozen en hij eene opmerkelijk goede uitspraak en toch gevoel0.083333, de ik dat het geen landgenoot van mij hierop vervolgde hij aldus

0.025000, "het zijn de gewone zeevaartkundige instrumenten" antwoordde ik "ik ken er het gebruik van maar er zijn nog anderen welke zonder twijfel voor de bijzondere inrichting van de nautilus bestemd zijn die wijzerplaat daar met beweegbare naald dat geen manometer"
0.027027, "geenszins mijnheer de professor" antwoordde de kapitein na eenige aarzeling "omdat gij dit vaartuig nimmer zult verlaten kom het salon dat onze ware studeerkamer en daar zult gij alles vernemen wat gij omtrent de nautilus weten moet"
0.019608, "welzeker mijnheer aronnax en die berekening gemakkelijk na te gaan nu heb ik nog andere vergaarbakken welke honderd ton inhoud hebben ik kan mij dus op ontzaglijke diepten laten zinken als ik weder stijgen wil heb ik het water slechts te verwijderen en als ik dan alle vergaarbakken ledig maak komt0.071429,  de nautilus weer voor een tiende deel van hare hoogte boven het watervlak uit"

0.333333, de zwarte stroom
0.020408, de zee heeft stroomen als het vaste land het zijn bijzondere stroomen kenbaar aan hun warmtegraad aan hunne kleur en van welke de merkwaardigste den naam van golfstroom draagt de wetenschap heeft op den aardbol de richting van vijf hoofdstroomen aangewezen het noorden en het zuiden van den atlantis0.019231, chen oceaan twee anderen het noorden en zuiden van de stille zuidzee en een vijfde het zuiden van den indischen oceaan zelfs het waarschijnlijk dat er een zesde het noorden van diezelfde zee bestaan heeft toen de kaspische zee en het meer aral met de groote aziatische meren verbonden slechts eene g0.250018, roote uitgestrektheid water vormden

0.020833, ik wachtte kapitein nemo maar hij kwam niet de klok stond op vijf uur ned land en koenraad gingen naar hunne hut ik naar mijne kamer mijn middagmaal stond gereed het bestond uit een overheerlijke schildpadsoep verder uit een boter gebakken barbeel wiens lever afzonderlijk klaargemaakt een voortreff0.052632, elijk eten opleverde en uit eenige sneden van een gebraden grooten visch waarvan de smaak lekkerder dan van zalm
0.020000, vijf dagen gingen aldus voorbij zonder dat de toestand veranderde iederen morgen ging ik op het plat dezelfde volzin werd telkens door denzelfden persoon uitgesproken de kapitein verscheen niet ik mijne partij gekozen om hem niet meer te zien toen ik den 16den november met ned en koenraad mijne kam0.027778, er terugkeerende op de tafel een brief aan mijn adres zag liggen ik brak dien met ongeduld open hij met eene duidelijke hand doch met eenigszins gothische letters geschreven dit schrift herinnerde aan de hoogduitsche type
0.018868, ik bekeek de kaart en vond op 40' nb en 50' ol een eilandje dat 1801 door kapitein crespo terug gevonden werd op oude spaansche kaarten komt het voor als racca de la plata hetwelk "zilverrots" beteekent wij waren dus op ongeveer 1800 kilometer verwijderd van de plaats vanwaar wij waren uitgegaan te0.034483, rwijl de nautilus haar koers eenigszins gewijzigd en ons naar het zuidoosten voerde ik wees mijne lotgenooten deze kleine rots welke vergeten 't midden van de stille zuidzee lag
0.019231, den volgenden dag 17 november voelde ik bij mijn ontwaken dat de nautilus onbeweeglijk stil lag ik kleedde mij haastig aan en ging naar de zaal daar wachtte mij kapitein nemo hij stond op groette mij en vroeg het ons aangenaam hem te vergezellen daar hij niets zeide van zijne achtdaagsche afwezighe0.045455, id paste ik wel op er niet te spreken en antwoordde eenvoudig dat mijne makkers en ik gereed waren hem te volgen
0.166667, "en gij wilt er mij brengen"
0.019231, op deze diepte van honderd meter zag ik de zonnestralen nog maar zwak op den helderen glans eene rosachtige schemering gevolgd zoo wat gelijkende op iets dat tusschen dag en nacht toch zagen wij nog genoeg om voort te kunnen gaan en het nog niet noodig om onze lichttoestellen werking te brengen
0.021739, eindelijk omstreeks vier uur waren wij aan het einde van onzen merkwaardigen tocht een muur van schoone rotsen van indrukwekkende gedaante verhief zich voor ons reusachtige blokken graniet waren hier op elkander gestapeld met vele donkere holen daartusschen doch nergens eene plaats te vinden waar d0.018182, ie rotsmuur bestegen kon worden het waren de grondvesten van het eiland crespo hier dus land de kapitein hield plotseling stil door eene beweging met de hand gebood hij ons hetzelfde te doen en hoe begeerig ik ook om om dien rotswand heen te komen zoo moest ik toch blijven staan hier eindigde het g0.037037, ebied van kapitein nemo hij wilde niet verder gaan deed hij het dan kwam hij op een gedeelte van den aardbol dat hij niet meer wilde betreden
0.021277, "ja" zeide hij "de oceaan bezit een wezenlijken omloop en om dien te weeg te brengen behoefde de schepper van alle dingen er slechts de warmte het zout en de diertjes te vermenigvuldigen warmte toch doet verschillende dichtheid ontstaan waardoor stroomen en tegenstroomen geboren worden de uitdampin0.020408, g die de noordelijke streken niet bestaat en den omtrek van den evenaar veelvuldig plaats vindt brengt eene aanhoudende verwisseling te weeg tusschen de wateren onder die keerkringen en aan de polen bovendien heb ik stroomen van boven naar beneden en omgekeerd ontdekt welke de ware ademhaling van d0.020408, en oceaan ik heb opgemerkt dat elk waterdeeltje aan de oppervlakte verwarmd wordt weder naar de diepte zakt zijn hoogsten graad van dichtheid twee graden onder nul bereikt daarna verder afkoelt lichter wordt en weder naar de oppervlakte stijgt aan de polen het gevolg van dat verschijnsel merkbaar e0.041667, n daar begrijpt gij waarom door de wetten van de voorzienende natuur bevriezing niet anders kan plaats hebben dan aan de oppervlakte des waters"
0.111111, "mijnheer aronnax weet gij hoe diep de oceaan is"
0.083333, "mijnheer nooit zoo gul geweest" zeide koenraad en daarmede ging hij heen
0.020000, ik gaarne dit 1400 kilometer lange rif eens bezocht waartegen de altijd ontstuimige zee met donderend geweld breekt maar op dat oogenblik sleepte de nautilus ons naar de diepte en ik zag niets van die hooge door koralen gevormde muren ik moest mij tevreden stellen met eenige staaltjes van visschen 0.200000, welke de netten gevangen waren
0.019608, "maar toch kapitein" antwoordde ik zonder acht te geven op de spotternij die zijne woorden doorstraalde "de nautilus gaan vast zitten bij hoog tij nu zijn de getijen den grooten oceaan niet zeer sterk en als gij nu de nautilus niet ontlasten kunt (hetgeen mij onmogelijk schijnt) dan begrijp ik niet0.166667,  hoe gij weder vlot zult komen"
0.040000, "hoe het ook zij" hernam de harpoenier "het eerste dier op vier op twee pooten met zonder vleugels krijgt een schot van mij zijn ribben"
0.043478, "wees niet bang mijnheer aronnax roei maar ferm op binnen vijf en twintig minuten zal ik u een kost naar mijn smaak opdisschen"
0.500000, hoofdstuk xxi
0.021277, ik zonderling te moede toen ik aan land stapte ned land stampte op den grond alsof hij dien bezit nam er waren echter nog maar twee maanden verloopen sinds wij volgens de uitdrukking van kapitein nemo "passagiers op de nautilus" maar inderdaad gevangenen van den kapitein waren
0.027027, "ned ned wat zegt gij daar" antwoordde koen "gij een menscheneter maar dan zou ik niet meer veilig bij u zijn met wien ik mijne hut moet deelen zal ik dan nog eens half opgegeten wakker worden"
0.019231, wij kwamen dus door het bosch terug en sneden daar nog eenige koppen uit jonge palmboomen welke wij als kool konden eten en vonden bovendien een soort van kleine snijboonen wij waren zwaar beladen toen wij de sloep bereikten ned land vond echter dat wij nog niet genoeg hadden het toeval begunstigde0.020001,  hem op het oogenblik dat wij ons zouden inschepen zag hij verscheidene boomen van 8 tot 10 meter hoog die tot de palmsoorten behoorden die boomen even kostbaar als de broodboom worden met recht onder de nuttigste van den geheelen maleischen archipel gerekend het waren sagoboomen die van zelven voo0.020000, rttelen zonder aangekweekt te worden daar zij evenals moerbeiboomen loten schieten en zich zelven zaaien ned land wist hoe men zulke boomen behandelen moest hij nam zijne bijl en die met groote kracht zwaaiende hij er weldra twee drie voor den grond doen vallen wier met witte stof overdekte bladere0.017857, n bewezen dat zij rijp waren ik keek er meer naar met het oog van een natuuronderzoeker dan van iemand die uitgehongerd hij begon met van elken stam eene reep schors van een centimeter breed af te scheuren waaronder een net van lange vezels lag dat uit niet te ontwarren knoopen bestond en met een s0.019231, oort van gomachtig meel aan elkander zat geplakt dit meel de sago welk voedsel vooral door de bevolking van dezen archipel genuttigd wordt ned land stelde zich voor het oogenblik tevreden met den stam stukken te hakken zooals hij met brandhout zou gedaan hebben hij behield zich voor om er later het0.045455,  meel uit te halen en op te zamelen en om het als het de zon wat gedroogd tormen te laten hard worden
0.111111, "het evenals jonge hoentjes die truffels eten" zeide koenraad
0.018868, de amerikaan sneed het open en haalde er de ingewanden uit toen sneed hij er vast een half dozijn ribbetjes uit welke hij voor ons avondmaal wilde roosteren daarop ving de jacht op nieuw aan welke nog blijken moest geven van de heldendaden van ned en koenraad de twee vrienden het kreupelhout doorkr0.035714, uisende joegen een troep kangoeroe's op die op hunne lange achterpooten wegvluchtten maar zij sprongen niet snel weg de electrieke kogel kon hen hunne vaart nog wel stuiten
0.026316, "wilden" antwoordde de kapitein op spotachtigen toon "en gij verwondert u mijnheer dat als gij ergens voet aan wal zet er wilden te vinden wilden waar zijn die niet en bovendien zijn die wilden erger dan alle anderen"
0.058824, ik riep koenraad die mij een klein schepnet bracht van de soort waarmede men gewoonlijk oesters vischt
0.058824, "inderdaad wij zijn omringd door prauwen en zullen binnen weinige minuten zeker door honderden wilden worden aangevallen'"
0.500000, "ja kapitein"
0.142857, "dat de nautilus evenals zij gestrand is"
0.125000, "neen mijn vriend maar wat doet ned land"
0.076923, "vriend ned maakt eene kangoeroepastij klaar die verbazend lekker moet worden" antwoordde koenraad
0.024390, ik stond 's morgens om zes uur op het luik niet open de lucht werd dus niet ververscht maar de vergaarbakken welke om alle mogelijke gebeurtenissen te voorkomen gevuld waren begonnen te werken en brachten eenige kubieke meter zuurstof de nautilus
0.166667, "zullen zij niet de nautilus komen"
0.050000, "gij zijt heer en meester" antwoordde ik hem en keek hem strak aan "doch mag ik u eene vraag doen"
0.500000, hoofdstuk xxiv
0.125000, "gij kunt vertrekken mijnheer aronnax" zeide kapitein nemo
0.020833, de koraal eene vereeniging van zeer kleine diertjes welke zich om de brooze en steenachtige huls van een polyp verzamelen die polypen hebben een eenigen oorsprong en ontstaan door uitbotting zij hebben een bijzondere natuur het dus een soort van natuurlijk socialisme ik kende de laatste werken welk0.030303, e die zonderling gevormde schepsels geschreven waren en niets kon mij dus meer belang inboezemen dan een van die versteende wouden te bezoeken welke de natuur op den bodem der zee geplant heeft
0.022727, na twee uur te zijn voortgegaan hadden wij eene diepte van omstreeks driehonderd meter bereikt dit ongeveer de grens der koralenvorming maar hier waren het niet meer enkele struikjes nederige boschjes het het groote woud het waren kolossale voortbrengselen uit het delfstoffenrijk prachtig versteend0.021739, e boomen welke door bevallige slingers verbonden waren waarop het licht met zijne schoonste kleuren speelde wij gingen vrij onder de hooge takken door terwijl voor onzen voet zich kleinere koralen als een bloemtapijt vertoonden welk een onbeschrijfelijk schouwspel hoe jammer dat wij elkander onze g0.020834, ewaarwordingen niet konden mededeelen waarom waren wij onder dit hulsel van metaal en glas verborgen waarom konden wij met elkander niet spreken waarom leefden wij niet als visschen welke het water bevolken nog liever als die uren lang zooals zij verkiezen op het land het water kunnen doorbrengen
0.022222, terwijl hij met den sextant bezig kwam een der matrozen dezelfde stevige zeebonk die ons op onzen eersten onderzeeschen tocht bij het eiland crespo vergezeld de glazen van de lantaarn schoonmaken ik beschouwde toen zeer nauwkeurig de inrichting van dit werktuig welks werking vierhonderdvoudigd werd0.023810,  door ringvormige lenzen die evenals de glazen op vuurtorens gesteld waren en daardoor het licht de vereischte richting deden schijnen de electrische lamp zoodanig ingericht dat zij zoo krachtig mogelijk werkte het licht toch schitterde het luchtledige waardoor tegelijkertijd regelmatigheid en held0.025641, erheid bevorderd werd bovendien werden daardoor de koolspitsen gespaard waartusschen zich de lichtstraal vertoonde dit voor den kapitein een belangrijke zuinigheidsmaatregel daar hij die stukken graphiet niet gemakkelijk kunnen vernieuwen onder deze omstandigheden echter sleten ze bijna het geheel 0.020408, van 21 tot 23 januari liep de nautilus met een vaart van tweeen twintig kilometer indien wij de onderscheiden soorten van visschen goed konden waarnemen dit omdat zij door het electrisch licht aangetrokken ons zochten bij te houden de meesten bleven achter sommigen echter bleven geruimen tijd ons z0.027027, tegen middernacht herkreeg de zee plotseling haar gewone kleur maar achter ons tot aan den gezichteinder weerkaatste de hemel de witte kleur der golven en bleef nog lang den schijn dragen alsof een zwak noorderlicht haar verlichtte
0.019231, den 28sten januari toen de nautilus om 12 uur weer aan het oppervlak verscheen bevonden wij ons op 4' nb en hadden acht kilometer westwaarts land het gezicht eerst zag ik een opeenstapeling van omstreeks 7000 meter hooge bergen met zeer grillige vormen toen de zonshoogte genomen ging ik naar den sa0.033333, lon en zag dat wij naar hetgeen op de kaart werd aangeteekend ons dicht bij ceylon bevonden dat als een parel aan de onderste punt van het indische schiereiland hangt
0.019231, en ik ging aan het droomen van haaien die ik mij voorstelde met groote kaken met een ruim aantal rijen tanden gewapend waarmee zij een mensch wel kunnen bijten ik voelde reeds wat pijn de lenden en dan kon ik de onverschilligheid niet verduwen waarmee de kapitein mij die ellendige uitnoodiging geda0.052632, an zou men niet gezegd hebben dat het niets anders dan om den vos zijn bosschen te gaan opjagen
0.062500, "niets mijnheer" antwoordde de amerikaan "dan alleen dit dat hij u ook die wandeling gesproken had"
0.090909, "verschilt de prijs der parels ook volgens de grootte" vroeg koenraad
0.019608, "niet alleen volgens de grootte" antwoordde ik "maar ook volgens den vorm volgens het water dat te zeggen de kleur en naar den schitterenden en veelkleurigen glans die ze zoo schoon voor het oog maakt de schoonste parels worden maagdelijke genoemd zij ontstaan op zich zelven de weefsels van het wee0.019608, kdier zij zijn wit soms ondoorschijnend maar soms ook wel doorschijnend en gewoonlijk rond langwerpig van vorm het eerste geval worden er armbanden het tweede geval oorbellen van gemaakt en daar zij de kostbaarste zijn worden zij bij het stuk verkocht de andere parels zitten aan de schelp vast en o0.026316, mdat zij onregelmatiger zijn worden deze bij het gewicht verkocht tot de minste soort behooren eindelijk de kleine parels die onder den naam van zaad bekend zijn zij worden bij de maat verkocht en gewoonlijk voor borduurwerk gebruikt"
0.083333, "maar die oplossing moet dan toch nog al wat kosten" vroeg ned
0.200000, "o elders" zei koenraad hoofdschuddend
0.021277, "het de vraag niet" hernam ik "om ze met een haak te vangen ze op het dek te hijschen den staart met een bijl af te hakken ze den buik open te snijden het hart en de ingewanden er uit te halen en die zee te smijten"
0.100002, vijf matrozen verbeidden met de riemen de hand onze komst

0.020833, om half negen waren wij weder op den nautilus daar overdacht ik de bijzonderheden van onzen tocht naar de oesterbank van manaar twee opmerkingen kwamen mij als vanzelf voor den geest ik dacht vooreerst aan de onvergelijkelijke stoutmoedigheid van kapitein nemo en ten anderen aan zijn opoffering voo0.021739, r een menschelijk wezen een der schepsels wier geslacht hij door altijd op zee te blijven vermeed hoe het ook zij die vreemdsoortige man er nog niet geslaagd zijn hart geheel te verstalen toen ik hem die opmerking maakte antwoordde hij mij met eenigszins bewogen stem
0.076923, wij hadden toen 16220 kilometer afgelegd sedert wij de japansche zee verlaten hadden
0.020000, toen wij die zee verlieten hadden wij een oogenblik mascate de belangrijkste stad van oman het gezicht ik bewonderde het vreemde uiterlijk dier plaats te midden van de haar omringende zwarte rotsen waartegen de witte forten en huizen zoo helder afsteken ik zag den ronden koepel der de bevallige pun0.019608, ten der minarets en de met frisch groen bedekte terrassen maar het slechts voorbijgaand want de nautilus schoot weldra weer onder de golven voorwaarts toen volgden wij op een afstand van zes kilometer de bochtige kusten van mahrah en hadhrahmout het zuiden van met hare bergen waarop zich hier en da0.020834, ar eenige bouwvallen vertoonden den 5den februari kwamen wij de golf van aden binnen die er uitziet als een trechter dien men den hals eener flesch heeft gestoken die flesch de roode zee en de hals babelmandeb waardoor het water uit de indische zee de roode getapt wordt

0.018519, den 9den februari dreef de nautilus het breedste gedeelte der roode zee dat tusschen suakin op de west en ghunfuda op de oostkust ter breedte van 190 kilometer gevonden wordt nadat de zonshoogte genomen kwam de kapitein op het plat waar ik mij op dat oogenblik bevond ik besloot bij mij zelven hem n0.017241, iet weer naar beneden te laten gaan voordat ik iets meer van zijn verdere plannen wist toen hij mij zag kwam hij naar mij toe bood mij een sigaar aan en zei "welnu mijnheer de professor hoe vindt gij de roode zee hebt gij de wonderen goed bekeken die zij bevat de visschen en de sponsenbedden en kor0.100000, aalbosschen hebt gij de steden op de kust kunnen zien"

0.166667, zijn geheele ziel lag dit woord
0.166667, welnu gij kunt het eens probeeren"
0.020000, van acht tot negen uur bleef de nautilus eenige meters diep onder water volgens mijn berekening moesten wij zeer dicht bij suez zijn door de ramen van den salon zag ik de rotsen die door ons electrisch licht helder werden beschenen het alsof het zeewater hoe langer hoe nauwer werd
0.020408, ik beken dat dergelijke gesprekken met ned land mij altijd verlegenheid brachten ik wilde de vrijheid mijner makkers op geenerlei wijze beletten doch ik verlangde nog volstrekt niet den kapitein te verlaten door toedoen ven hem en zijn vaartuig vermeerderde ik dagelijks mijn kennis van de zee en ik0.019608,  bewerkte mijn boek de diepte dit element zelf zou ik ooit zulk een gelegenheid weer vinden om de wonderen van den oceaan te kunnen aanschouwen neen zeker niet ik kon mij dus niet vereenigen met het denkbeeld den nautilus vaarwel te zeggen voordat ik den kring mijner onderzoekingen den geheelen omt0.250000, rek der aarde voltooid
0.022222, "dan zou ik trachten van de sloep meester te maken ik weet ermee om te gaan wij gaan er binnen zitten en als wij de ijzeren bouten er uit hebben geschroefd rijzen wij naar de oppervlakte zonder dat zelfs de stuurman onze vlucht zou bemerken"
0.021277, ik zei geen woord ik keek slechts toe kapitein nemo nam de staven voor en schoof ze geregeld een kist die hij er geheel mede vulde ik hield het er voor dat deze meer dan duizend kilogrammen goud bevatte dat te zeggen voor ongeveer drie millioen franken
0.037037, den volgenden dag vertelde ik aan ned en koenraad wat er dien nacht gebeurd en mijn nieuwsgierigheid zeer opgewekt mijn makkers waren niet minder verbaasd dan ik
0.024390, de middellandsche zee de blauwe zee bij uitnemendheid omringd door kusten waarop oranjeboomen cactussen en pijnboomen groeien en mirten hunne welriekende geuren verspreiden waarlangs ruwe bergen hunne toppen hemelwaarts verheffen waarboven het zuiver en doorschijnend luchtazuur zich welft de zee di0.024390, e onophoudelijk door stormen door onderaardsch vuur beweging wordt gebracht voortdurend het slagveld waar neptunus en pluto elkander het wereldgebied betwisten aan haar oevers en op haar golven wordt de mensch een van de krachtigste luchtstreken van den aardbodem als wedergeboren
0.020409, doch hoe schoon die zee ook zij ik heb maar een vluchtig overzicht kunnen nemen van dat waterbekken dat twee millioen vierkante kilometer oppervlakte beslaat de kennis van den kapitein hielp mij hier ook weinig want die raadselachtige persoon verscheen bij deze snelle vaart geen enkele maal ik scha0.018868, t den afstand dien de nautilus onder zee aflegde op ongeveer 2400 kilometer en deze reis legde hij tweemaal vierentwintig uren af na den 16den februari de grieksche wateren verlaten te hebben waren wij den 18den bij het opkomen van de zon reeds door de straat van gibraltar het mij daardoor vrij dui0.021277, delijk dat deze middellandsche zee besloten tusschen bewoonde landen die hij wilde ontvluchten den kapitein bijzonder onaangenaam moest zijn hare golven en koeltjes wekten waarschijnlijk bij hem al te veel droeve herinneringen mogelijk al te veel leed op hij kon zich hier met zijn vaartuig niet zoo0.021739,  vrij bewegen als den oceaan en zijn nautilus voelde zich tusschen de te nabij elkander liggende afrikaansche en europeesche kusten te bekneld wij hadden een snelheid van vijfenveertig kilometer het uur het spreekt van zelf dat ned land tot zijn groote spijt zijn ontvluchtingsplannen moest opgeven 0.019609, hij kon zich van de sloep niet bedienen nu deze werd meegesleept met een vaart van ongeveer twaalf meter de seconde onder die omstandigheden den nautilus te verlaten zou even gevaarlijk geweest zijn als om uit een sneltrein volle vaart te springen bovendien kwam ons vaartuig alleen des nachts aan d0.043478, e oppervlakte om een voorraad versche lucht te nemen en het snelde slechts vooruit volgens de aanwijzingen van het kompas en den log
0.047619, "dan hebben wij nog tijd om onze reis te eindigen als ned land zich er tenminste niet mee bemoeit" antwoordde koenraad
0.062500, "die vervloekte kapitein hield ook juist stil op het oogenblik dat wij zijn schuit zouden ontvluchten"
0.019231, dit waren de geschiedkundige herinneringen die het door kapitein nemo geschreven woord bij mij levendig deden worden zoo stond ik dan door het vreemdste lot gedreven thans op een der bergen van dit verdwenen land ik raakte als het ware met de hand die duizend eeuwen oude bouwvallen aan tot een voor0.025000, wereldlijk tijdperk behoorend ik betrad den grond waarop de tijdgenooten van den eersten mensch hadden gewoond ik verbrijzelde onder mijn voet de skeletten van dieren uit de fabelachtige tijden die onder de schaduw van de thans versteende boomen hadden gerust
0.250000, "onder den grond mijnheer"
0.090909, "maar zou men door dien krater niet naar beneden kunnen afdalen"

0.020833, dien dag doorkliefde de nautilus een zonderling gedeelte van den atlantischen oceaan iedereen kent het bestaan van den warmen stroom die onder den naam van golfstroom bekend nadat hij de golf van mexico onder langs kaap sable verlaten heeft richt hij zich rechtstreeks naar spitsbergen doch op ongev0.020001, eer nb even nadat hij de golf van mexico heeft verlaten verdeelt hij zich twee takken de voornaamste richt zich naar de kusten van ijsland en noorwegen terwijl de andere op de hoogte der azorische eilanden zuidwaarts stroomt en daarna tegen de afrikaansche kust stuitende een ovaal beschrijft en naa0.250000, r de antillen terugkeert
0.027027, "ik verklaar dit uit twee oorzaken" antwoordde ik "vooreerst omdat de vertikale stroomen ontstaan door het verschil zoutgehalte en door de dichtheid van het water een beweging veroorzaken die genoegzaam om het leven van zeesterren te onderhouden"
0.111111, "het doet er niet toe" drong ned land aan
0.018868, "mijnheer vergunt mij zeker wel om een opmerking te maken" zei koenraad toen "die arme ned denkt aan alles wat hij niet krijgen kan zijn geheele vroegere leven komt hem weer voor den geest hij treurt om alles wat wij missen zijn vroegere herinneringen kwellen hem zijn gemoed vol men moet hem begrij0.024390, pen wat kan hij hier uitrichten niets hij geen geleerde zooals mijnheer en kan niet zooals wij liefhebberij hebben al het wonderschoone dat de zee oplevert hij zou er alles voor wagen om eens zijn land een kroeg te kunnen zitten"
0.066667, ned stampte op den grond en kneep zijn vuist samen alsof hij een harpoen drilde
0.038462, "goed gevonden mijnheer aronnax" antwoordde de kapitein glimlachende "doch omdat ik niet wil dat ge mij van roekeloosheid beschuldigt moet ik u al mijn zwarigheden tegenwerpen"
0.071429, "ziet gij mijnheer" zei hij "ik heb medelijden met u en uw kapitein nemo"
0.018868, een tiental mannen beklommen de zijwanden van den nautilus en hakten het ijs rondom het vaartuig weg zoodat zij het weldra los hadden het spoedig gedaan omdat het pas gevormde ijs nog dun toen gingen wij allen naar binnen de gewone vergaarbakken werden gevuld met het water dat onder de kiel nog nie0.500000, t bevroren
0.020000, gedurende een gedeelte van den nacht bleven koen en ik door het ongewone van onzen toestand teruggehouden het raam van den salon zitten de zee werd door onze electrische lantaarn verlicht maar zij geheel verlaten de visschen hielden zich deze altijd bevroren niet op zij gebruikten die alleen om er 0.040000, uit de ijszee naar de open poolzee door te zwemmen wij liepen verbazend snel ik voelde dit aan het trillen van het lange ijzeren vaartuig
0.020833, gedurende dien dag herhaalde de nautilus deze proef meermalen doch stiet telkens tegen den ijsbodem boven ons op sommige oogenblikken vonden wij die op 900 meter diepte zoodat de bank 1200 meter hoog dik dit dus driemaal dikker dan op de plaats waar wij naar beneden waren gegaan
0.018868, tien kilometer van den nautilus verhief zich naar het zuiden een eenzaam eiland tot op twee honderd meter boven de zee wij voeren er heen doch met de grootste omzichtigheid want het vaarwater kon vol klippen zijn een uur daarna waren wij op het eiland twee uur daarna hadden wij het rondgevaren het 0.020833, vijf kilometer omtrek een nauw kanaal scheidde het van een groot land misschien wel een vastland waarvan wij het einde niet konden zien het bestaan van dit land scheen de veronderstelling van maury te wettigen die schrandere amerikaan namelijk opgemerkt dat tusschen de zuidpool en de zestigste para0.020000, llel de zee met zeer groote drijvende ijsschotsen bedekt wat men het noorden nimmer ziet daaruit hij het gevolg getrokken dat er aan de zuidpool een groot vasteland moest wezen omdat zulke ijsschotsen nimmer volle zee maar alleen op kusten kunnen ontstaan volgens zijn berekening vormt het ijs aan d0.125000, e zuidpool een massa van 4000 kilometer oppervlakte
0.043478, de plantengroei op dit land uiterst gering op de zwarte rotsen groeiden enkele mossen deze vormden met enkele mikroskopische plantjes de geheele flora

0.500000, hoofdstuk xxxix
0.500000, ongeluk toeval
0.166667, "wat beteekent dat" riep ik uit
0.111111, "en ik geloof het nog niet" antwoordde de amerikaan
0.066667, die woorden den mond van een kalmen vlaming bewezen genoegzaam welke mate zijn opgewondenheid gestegen
0.125000, een kwartier daarna naderde koenraad mij en zei
0.200012, "zeker want wij liggen stil"
0.017857, het scheen mij toe dat het water erg koud doch ik werd spoedig warm door het werk ik vrij mijn bewegingen hoewel mijn lichaam een drukking van dertig atmosferen ondervond toen ik na twee uren werkens weer binnen kwam om wat te eten en te rusten vond ik een merkbaar verschil tusschen de lucht uit he0.034483, t toestel van rouquayrol en de atmosfeer die ons den nautilus omringde sedert tweemaal vier en twintig uur de lucht niet ververscht en de levenskracht er dus van afgenomen
0.018868, zooals ik dacht er gedurende den nacht weer een meter dikte van het ijs afgehakt doch toen ik den volgenden morgen met mijn scaphander aan onder een temperatuur van zes tot zeven graden onder nul door het zeewater liep zag ik dat de zijmuren ons langzamerhand naderden het water dat op eenigen afsta0.021277, nd niet verwarmd werd door onzen arbeid en door de beweging begon langzamerhand te stollen wat beteekenden tegenover dit nieuw en dreigend gevaar onze kansen op behoud en hoe zouden wij deze ijsvorming kunnen tegengaan die de nautilus als een stuk glas uit elkander zou doen springen
0.018868, een huivering liep mij de leden en toch behoefde ik mij dit antwoord niet te verwonderen den 22en maart de nautilus de open poolzee ondergedoken wij hadden nu den 26en sedert vijf dagen leefden wij van saamgeperste lucht en wat er nog overbleef moest voor de werklieden bewaard blijven nu ik deze di0.037037, ngen beschrijf gevoel ik daarvan nog den indruk dat een onwillekeurige huivering zich van mij meester maakt en ik mij verbeeld gebrek te hebben aan versche lucht
0.021277, toen ik weer binnen boord kwam stikte ik bijna welk een nacht ik kan dien niet beschrijven zulk lijden kan niet beschreven worden den volgenden morgen ademhaling bijna onmogelijk ik zware hoofdpijn en alles duizelde mij alsof ik dronken mijn makkers gevoelden hetzelfde eenige matrozen der bemanning0.500000,  lagen stervende
0.111111, "wij zijn er door" fluisterde koenraad mij 't oor
0.041667, "neen ned" antwoordde ik "het niet meer waard niemands leven meer waard dan dat van een edelmoedig en goed mensch en dat ben jij"
0.200000, "goed goed" zei ned verlegen
0.020000, tegen den avond kwamen wij bij den archipel der malouinen wier scherpe toppen ik den volgenden morgen kon zien de zee hier maar middelmatig diep ik dacht derhalve en niet zonder reden dat deze eilanden vroeger met het vuurland als een groot vasteland verbonden waren zij werden waarschijnlijk door d0.024390, en beroemden john davis ontdekt die er den naam van davis zuidereilanden aan gaf later noemde richard hawkens ze maagdeneilanden totdat zij 't begin der achttiende eeuw door visschers van st malo malouinen en eindelijk door de engelschen falklandseilanden genoemd werden
0.021740, voor dit uitstel kon ik mij gemakkelijk schadeloos stellen door belangwekkende want gedurende den 11den en 12den april bleef de nautilus op de oppervlakte drijven en haalden zijn netten telkens een wonderbaarlijke hoeveelheid visch naar boven ook kruipende dieren en zaten daartusschen er waren er o0.058824, nder van allerlei zeldzame soorten wier opsomming te lang zou duren een geval wil ik echter mededeelen
0.500000, "en hoe"
0.020408, ik verzocht ned dus mij eerst eens te laten nadenken voordat ik handelde indien deze poging niet slaagde kon zij slechts zijn achterdocht opwekken onzen toestand onhoudbaar maken en de plannen van den amerikaan benadeelen ik zal er nog bijvoegen dat ik op geenerlei wijze onze slechte gezondheid als0.021739,  bewijs kon aanvoeren als men die ellendige oogenblikken onder de ijsbank van de zuidpool uitzondert dan onze gezondheid nooit beter geweest het krachtig voedsel de zuivere lucht de geregelde levenswijs de gelijkmatige temperatuur dat alles weerde elke ziekte en voor iemand die geen heimwee naar de0.019231,  genoegens op het land voor iemand als kapitein nemo die zich te huis gevoelt die door middelen welke voor ieder behalve voor hem geheimen zijn zijn doel zocht te bereiken voor zoo iemand begreep ik zulk een bestaan maar wij hadden niet met de menschheid gebroken ik voor mij wilde mijn zonderlinge 0.034483, en nieuwe niet met mij te gronde doen gaan nu heb ik het recht een boek de zee te schrijven ik wilde dit vroeger later het licht doen zien
0.111111, "gelooft mijnheer dus niet aan reusachtige inktvisschen" vroeg koenraad
0.200000, "mooi zoo" lachte de amerikaan
0.041667, "welnu als mijnheer mij niet kwalijk neemt" antwoordde koenraad dood bedaard "dan hier zoo niet de inktvisch van bouguer dan toch van zijn broertjes"
0.200000, "wat verschrikkelijk beest" riep hij
0.090909, plotseling hield de nautilus stil een schok deed het vaartuig trillen
0.083333, ik keek den kapitein aan en meende niet goed gehoord te hebben
0.035716, "zeker niet want de electrische kogels werken niets uit dat weeke vleesch waar zij geen tegenstand genoeg vinden om te springen maar wij zullen ze met bijlen aanvallen"
0.041667, daar stonden een tiental mannen met enterbijlen de hand ten aanval gereed koen en ik namen ieder een bijl ned land greep een harpoen
0.022728, tegen den middag stond ik met koenraad op het plat ik deelde hem eenige bijzonderheden omtrent den golfstroom mede toen ik verzocht ik hem de hand eens het water te steken koenraad deed het en verwonderd geen enkele gewaarwording van warmte koude te voelen
0.020000, deze stroom sleept een gansche wereld van levende wezens met zich de argonauten die de middellandsche zee nog al eens voorkomen zwommen er bij groote troepen allerhande soorten van visschen roggen haaien enz spartelden verder om ons heen en 's nachts lichtte het water van den golfstroom dat het lic0.062500, ht met onze lantaarn wedijverden vooral als ons stormachtig weder dreigde zooals nog al dikwijls gebeurde
0.029412, de naam van den man zijn levensgeschiedenis door hem zelven geschreven zijn geheim zou dus eenmaal ontsluierd worden maar op dat oogenblik zag ik die medeeling alleen een middel om het gesprek te beginnen
0.142857, "het dus slavernij waartoe gij ons veroordeelt"
0.018519, gedurende den nacht nam de hevigheid van den storm nog toe de barometer daalde evenals 1860 op het eiland bourbon gedurende een cykloon tot 710 mm de schemering zag ik aan den gezichteinder een groot schip dat met den storm worstelde het voer onder halven stoom om zich op de golven overeind te houd0.050000, en waarschijnlijk het een van de stoombooten van de lijn van newyork naar liverpool havre het verdween weldra de duisternis
0.020408, op den regen volgde een stroom van vuur de regendruppels veranderden vurige vonken men zou gezegd hebben dat kapitein nemo een hem waardigen dood willen sterven en hij daarom gaarne door den bliksem getroffen wilde worden bij het ontzettend stampen en slingeren van den nautilus verhief deze zich ee0.052632, n oogenblik met de voorpunt de lucht en ik zag er evenals van een bliksemafleider tal van vonken afspringen
0.020408, terwijl wij strijkelings de bank van newfoundland heen liepen zag ik duidelijk de lange zetlijnen elk met tweehonderd haken welke elk schip met een paar dozijn tegelijk uithangt elke lijn zat aan de oppervlakte der zee vast aan een groot stuk kurk de nautilus moest behendig tusschen dit onderzeesch0.029413, e net doorvaren doch hij bleef niet lang deze streken want het schip zette den koers voort tot op nb het op de hoogte van st john dat de onderzeesche telegraafkabel aan land komt
0.142857, "wat schieten zij op ons" riep ik
0.111111, "goed" antwoordde ned "maar wat het voor een schip"
0.027027, eens op een morgen (ik weet niet welke dag het was) zat ik nog zeer vroeg droeve gepeinzen verzonken toen ik opkeek stond ned land mij en ik hoorde hem met zachte stem zeggen "wij zullen vluchten"
0.250000, "ik zal u volgen"
0.019231, het een dwaze inval ik hield mij gelukkig en ging op mijn bed liggen om die onrust een weinig te doen bedaren langzamerhand werd ik wat kalmer maar mijn al te opgewonden geest deed mij als 't ware mijn geheele verblijf aan boord van den nautilus vluchtig overzien alle gelukkige ongelukkige gebeurte0.020833, nissen die mij sedert mijn verdwijning van de abraham lincoln waren overkomen de onderzeesche jacht de torresstraat de woeste papoea's de stranding het koralen kerkhof de arabische tunnel het eiland santorino de duiker van creta de baai van vigo atlantis de ijsbank de zuidpool de insluiting het ijs0.021739,  het gevecht met de inktvisschen de storm den golfstroom de vengeur en het verschrikkelijk tooneel van het schip dat met zijn geheele bemanning den grond werd geboord al die gebeurtenissen kwamen mij achtereenvolgens voor oogen evenals een beschilderd doek dat achter op het tooneel voorbijschuift k0.028571, apitein nemo werd mijn verbeelding ontzaglijk groot te midden van al die vreemde voorvallen zijn vormen werden breed hij nam een bovenmenschelijke gedaante aan hij niet meer mijns gelijke het de waterbewoner de beheerscher der

0.026316, de amerikaan hield met zijn werk op maar een twintigmalen herhaald een verschrikkelijk woord deed mij de oorzaak van het rumoer kennen dat aan boord van den nautilus heerschte het niet op ons dat haar bemanning het gemunt
