0.043478, op dat oogenblik bemerkte ik bij het licht der reeds ondergaande maan een gelaat dat niet van koenraad maar hetwelk ik aanstonds herkende
0.018519, de man met dien zachten en kalmen oogopslag hoorde mij bedaard beleefd en met de grootste oplettendheid aan maar geen trek van zijn gelaat verried dat hij mij begrepen toen ik gedaan sprak hij geen woord ik kon nu nog beproeven hem het engelsch aan te spreken misschien verstond hij die taal ik kend0.029412, e haar en ook hoogduitsch maar beiden slechts genoeg om ze vlug te lezen doch niet om ze vlot te spreken en hier kwam het er vooral op aan om mij te doen verstaan
0.020408, ned liet het zich geen tweemaal zeggen en begon hetzelfde verhaal als het mijne het den grond hetzelfde alleen de vorm verschilde de harpoenier door zijn driftig karakter medegesleept sprak met zeer veel vuur hij beklaagde zich hevig dat hij tegen alle recht en billijkheid gevangen werd gehouden vr0.021739, oeg volgens welke wet men hem vasthield riep de habeas corpusakte dreigde hen te vervolgen die hem onrechtvaardig opsloten zwaaide met zijn armen schreeuwde en gaf eindelijk door zijne gebaren te kennen dat wij van honger stierven dit volkomen waar doch wij hadden het bijna vergeten
0.047619, "dat nu het onaangename van niet alle talen te kennen" antwoordde koenraad "of het nadeel van niet eenige wereldtaal te bezitten"
0.020408, toen ik die zuivere lucht met volle borst ingeademd zocht ik naar de geleidingsbuizen welke dien weldadigen luchtstroom tot ons deden komen en ik vond die spoedig boven de deur een luchtgat waardoor een stroom versche lucht kon binnen komen om de bedorven atmosfeer van onze cel te ververschen
0.076923, "dat spreek ik tegen" zeide ik "wij zijn niet handen van menscheneters gevallen"

0.083333, "wees bedaard mijnheer land en gij mijnheer de professor hoor mij aan"

0.021277, ik het eerste oogenblik verwonderd de bijzondere lucht welke deze ruimte vervulde de kapitein bemerkte dit "het zijn eenige gasachtige producten" zeide hij "welke het gevolg zijn van het gebruik van sodium overigens zuiveren wij elken morgen het geheele vaartuig door er versche lucht te laten stroo0.125000, "ik brand van ongeduld om het te vernemen"

0.019231, kapitein nemo ging met zijn sextant de hand de hoogte der zon opnemen waardoor hij de breedte leerde kennen hij wachtte eenige minuten totdat de zon hare grootste hoogte bereikt terwijl hij zijne deed bewoog zich geen enkele spier van zijn lichaam en het instrument zou de hand van een marmeren beel0.166667, d niet onbeweeglijker hebben kunnen zijn

0.020833, de zee op een kilometer afstands rondom de nautilus duidelijk zichtbaar welk een schouwspel welke pen zou dit kunnen beschrijven wie zou de uitwerking van het licht door deze doorschijnende massa en het zachte afnemen en verminderen daarvan de diepten boven en beneden ons kunnen afschilderen men ke0.021739, nt de doorschijnendheid der zee men weet dat haar water helderder dan bronwater de minerale en organische bestanddeelen welke er opgelost zijn vermeerderen die doorschijnendheid enkele gedeelten van den oceaan bij de antillen bijvoorbeeld kan men op eene diepte van 145 meter den zandigen bodem met 0.021277, bijzondere nauwkeurigheid zien en zelfs schijnen de zonnestralen nog tot op eene diepte van 300 meter door te dringen maar den stroom waarin de nautilus dreef werd het electriek licht de diepte der zee zelve voortgebracht het geen verlicht water meer maar een stroom van vloeibaar licht
0.066667, "welzeker" antwoordde de harpoenier ernstig "in visschen die men eet en die men niet eet"

0.020408, koenraad bij dit prachtig schouwspel evenals ik blijven stilstaan zeker die brave jongen bij die massa en molusken weder aan het rangschikken duizenden soorten van planten en dieren toch lagen op den bodem en het speet mij telkens als ik schoone exemplaren er van plattrapte doch wij moesten vooruit0.019608,  wij gingen te midden van al die wonderen voort ik mocht mij nauwelijks een oogenblik ophouden want ik volgde den kapitein die mij telkens met een wenk riep weldra veranderde de aard van den bodem op de zandvlakte volgde een laag kleverige modder die uit kalkschelpen ontstaan daarop gingen wij door0.021277,  eene weide van zeegras en zwamplanten van wonderlijke groeikracht deze dichtbegroeide perken waren zacht om op te loopen en konden met de zachtste door menschenhanden geweven tapijten wedijveren maar terwijl het groen onder onze voeten zich uitspreidde het ook boven ons hoofd te vinden er vormde z0.019608, ich nu en dan als een prieel van zeeplanten welke allen tot de grassen behoorden waarvan men meer dan duizend soorten kent de kleuren der planten waren ook verschillend waarbij ik opmerkte dat de groene planten meer tot de oppervlakte der zee naderden terwijl de roode op eene middelmatige diepte en0.090909,  de zwarte bruine de grootste diepten van den oceaan gevonden werden

0.026316, "zeer goed mijnheer" antwoordde de kapitein "doch wij zullen u hoop ik iets beters toonen wat de gemiddelde diepte van dit gedeelte van de stille zuidzee aangaat zoo deel ik u mede dat zij slechts 4000 meter bedraagt"
0.023810, kapitein nemo bezocht mij slechts zeer zelden de daarop volgende weken nu en dan vertoonde hij zich een oogenblik zijn eerste stuurman wees geregeld met punten op de kaart den weg aan welken de nautilus volgde zoodat ik dien geregeld kon nagaan

0.200000, "een schip" riep ik uit
0.076923, "het zijn geen nieuwe vastelanden welke de aarde noodig heeft maar nieuwe menschen"
0.030303, toen koenraad mij vroeg hoe lang het wel duurde eer zulke groote rotsen gevormd waren verwonderde hij zich zeer dat de geleerden meenen dat zij gedurende eene eeuw slechts een achtste centimeter groeiden
0.017242, "ik ook" antwoordde koenraad "ik denk er dus even sterk om te blijven als ned om te vluchten als dus het nieuw begonnen jaar voor mij niet goed dan zal het voor hem goed zijn en omgekeerd op die wijze zal er toch altijd iemand tevreden zijn kortom ik wensch mijnheer veel heil en zegen 't nieuwe jaa0.020833, de torrestraat ongeveer 135 kilometer breed maar zoo vol klippen rotsen eilandjes en riffen dat de vaart er bijna onmogelijk derhalve nam kapitein nemo alle mogelijke voorzorgen om er door te komen de nautilus die de oppervlakte dreef voer slechts bedaard voorwaarts de schroef bewoog zich slechts l0.029412, toen de kapitein dit gezegd ging hij met zijn eersten stuurman weder naar binnen de nautilus bewoog zich niet en bleef onwrikbaar vast liggen alsof de koralen het vaartuig reeds voor goed hadden ingemetseld
0.062500, "welnu mijnheer" zeide ned land die na het vertrek van den kapitein naar mij toe kwam

0.020833, na weinige minuten het gedeelte der vrucht dat aan den gloed van het vuur blootgesteld geweest geheel verkoold het binnenste een wit deeg een soort van week kruim waarvan de geur aan artisjokken deed denken ik moet het bekennen dit brood voortreffelijk en ik het met groot genoegen

0.017857, met het opgaan der zon waren wij op weg weinige oogenblikken bereikte onze sloep met behulp van een gunstigen stroom het eiland wij gingen aan land en omdat wij dachten dat het goed als wij aan het verlangen van ned land voldeden volgden wij hem doch hadden werk om hem met zijne lange beenen bij te0.022727, de amerikaan liep de kust westelijke richting langs daarna doorwaadde hij eenige kleine riviertjes en ging naar eene hoogvlakte welke door wonderschoone bosschen begrensd werd eenige ijsvogels zwierven langs de riviertjes doch lieten zich niet benaderen hunne schuwheid bewees mij dat die vogels wis0.030303, ten wat zij van wezens van onze soort te wachten hadden en ik maakte daaruit de gevolgtrekking dat als het eiland al niet bewoond er ten minste van tijd tot tijd menschen kwamen
0.043479, "ik zal het beproeven mijnheer de professor hoewel ik meer gewoon ben om met den harpoen dan met het geweer om te gaan"

0.020833, zonder dralen begon ned land aan het gewichtig werk voor ons diner hij verstond de kookkunst bijzonder goed weldra verspreidden de varkensribbetjes die hij boven een kolenvuur roosterde een aangenamen geur doch ik bemerk dat ik den amerikaan nadoe ik raak nu reeds opgewonden door een geroosterd var0.111111, kensribbetje men vergeve het mij zooals aan ned land
0.055556, "o zijt gij het mijnheer de professor welnu hebt gij eene goede jacht gehad en schoone planten verzameld"
0.025641, "mijnheer aronnax" hernam de kapitein die zijne vingers weer de toetsen van het orgel liet gaan "als al de inboorlingen van nieuwguinea op dat strand bij elkander waren dan zou de nautilus niets van hunne aanvallen te vreezen hebben"
0.041667, "men kan menscheneter en braaf zijn" hernam koenraad "even zooals men gulzig en eerlijk man kan wezen het eene sluit het andere niet uit"

0.050000, "mijnheer aronnax" zeide nemo bedaard "men komt het luik van de nautilus zoo maar niet binnen al staat het open"
0.066671, "welnu dan moet mijnheer ontbijten het voorzichtig want wij weten niet wat er gebeuren kan"
0.038462, ik hoorde het luik sluiten en bemerkte dat het lichte slingeren van het vaartuig door de deining der zee ophield zakte de nautilus naar de diepte
0.017544, ik wilde gaarne mijne kamer verlaten doch zou ik daartoe wel de vrijheid hebben ik opende de deur ik volkomen vrij ik ging door den gang naar de trap het luik weder geopend en ik kwam op het plat ned land en koenraad wachtten er mij reeds ik ondervroeg hen zij wisten niets een zwaren slaap gedompel0.058824, d welke hun alle herinnering ontnam waren zij zeer verwonderd geweest hunne hut op bed te liggen
0.018869, tegen twee uur ik de salon bezig om aanteekeningen te maken toen de deur openging en de kapitein verscheen ik groette hem hij groette slechts even terug zonder te spreken ik ging weder aan mijn werk hopende dat hij mij eenige verklaring zoude geven van de gebeurtenissen van den vorigen nacht doch n0.019231, iets daarvan ik zag hem eens aan hij scheen vermoeid zijne roode oogen bewezen dat hij niet geslapen zijn gelaat drukte diepe droefheid eene wezenlijke smart uit hij wandelde heen en weder ging zitten en stond weer op nam een boek op en legde het aanstonds weer neer beschouwde zijne instrumenten zo0.066667, nder daarbij zijne gewone aanteekeningen te maken en scheen geen oogenblik stil te kunnen blijven
0.125000, eindelijk kwam hij naar mij toe en zeide
0.142857, "ik ben gereed om u te volgen"
0.040000, neen nimmer mijn geest zoo ontroerd nooit hadden indrukwekkender gedachten zich van mij meester gemaakt ik wilde niet zien wat ik toch voor oogen zag
0.020833, het graf werd intusschen langzaam gegraven de visschen vluchten links en rechts uit hunne verontruste schuilhoeken ik hoorde het houweelijzer weerklinken op den kalkachtigen bodem waaruit soms vonken te voorschijn sprongen als het metaal een stuk kiezel trof dat hier op den bodem der zee lag het ga0.018519, t werd langer en breeder en weldra het ook diep genoeg om het lijk te bevatten toen naderden de dragers het lijk een wit kleed gehuld werd zijn vochtig graf nedergelegd de kapitein kruiste de armen de borst en knielde met al zijne volgelingen naast het lijk van hun vriend eene biddende houding nede0.032258, r mijne beide makkers en ik bogen eerbiedig het hoofd toen werd het graf bedekt met de rotsstukken welke uit den grond waren gehakt zoodat het evenzeer eene kleine verhevenheid vormde
0.043479, toen ik van kleeding veranderd ging ik naar het plat en zette mij bij de lantaarn neder ten prooi aan de somberste gedachten
0.250000, [1] beweeglijk het onbeweeglijke
0.333333, de indische oceaan
0.020834, den 25sten januari de zee geheel verlaten de nautilus dreef den ganschen dag aan de oppervlakte en joeg het water met zijn krachtige schroef eenige voeten omhoog wie zou het vaartuig onderzulke omstandigheden niet voor een reusachtige zeemonster hebben gehouden ik bracht drie vierde van dien dag do0.018519, or op het plat om de zee te beschouwen ik zag niets aan den gezichteinder behalve tegen vier uur den middag toen ik een groote stoomboot westelijke richting zag voortstoomen een oogenblik kon ik de masten zien doch men kon aan boord van die boot den nautilus niet gewaar worden omdat hij bijna gelij0.037038, k met het water dreef ik dacht dat deze boot aan de peninsular oriental company behoorde die den dienst verricht tusschen ceylon en sidney en melbourne aandoet
0.020833, gedurende een uur dreef de nautilus te midden van die weekdieren toen werden deze plotseling door ik weet niet welken schrik bevangen als op een gegeven teeken gingen de zeiltjes naar beneden de voelarmen werden ingetrokken het lichaam kromp samen de schelpen keerden om veranderden daardoor haar zw0.043478, aartepunt en verdwenen plotseling onder de golven het het werk van een oogenblik nimmer manoeuvreerden de schepen van een vloot met meer juistheid
0.021739, ik weet niet koenraad mijn raad ter harte nam maar hij scheen diep gedachten verzonken omdat hij vast eens wilde uitrekenen hoeveel vijfde millimeters er op een lengte van veertig kilometer begrepen zijn ik bleef het verschijnsel beschouwen de nautilus doorkliefde gedurende verscheiden uren deze wi0.028572, tte golven en ik merkte op dat hij zonder eenig geruisch door dit op zeepsop gelijkend water voer als ware het schuim dat de verschillende richting stroomende golven dikwijls de een andere baai doen ontstaan

0.050000, "neen ned dat weet ik niet ik wil het niet weten en ik tel niet eens de dagen de uren"
0.025001, "ik stem dit toe want de stoom schijnt de dankbaarheid het hart der zeelieden te hebben uitgedoofd maar kapitein daar gij deze zee bijzonder schijnt bestudeerd te hebben zult gij mij misschien wel kunnen zeggen hoe haar naam ontstaan is"

0.055556, "mijnheer" antwoordde mij de kapitein "er kan geen geheim bestaan tusschen menschen die elkander niet meer verlaten moeten"
0.058824, "een onderzeesche tunnel" riep hij uit "een gemeenschap tusschen de beide wie heeft daar ooit van gehoord"
0.018868, ik beschouwde stilte den hoogen en steilen rotsmuur waar wij langs voeren wij volgden dien gedurende een uur en bleven er den regel slechts een paar meter van verwijderd de kapitein hield het oog geen enkel oogenblik afgewend van het kompas dat een ring aan den zolder hing op een enkel teeken veran0.029412, derde de stuurman elk oogenblik de richting van den nautilus ik zat bij het glas aan bakboordzijde en zag prachtige koralen zeegrassen schaaldieren die hunne lange pooten uit de spleten der rots staken enz
0.024390, ik zag wel waar de amerikaan heen wilde allen gevalle achtte ik het beter er te praten omdat hij het begeerde en wij gingen met ons bij de lantaarn zitten waar wij minder gevaar liepen door den golfslag bespat te worden
0.034483, "vriend ned" zeide ik "antwoord mij eens openhartig verveelt gij u aan boord hebt j' er spijt van dat het lot je de macht van kapitein nemo heeft gebracht"
0.166667, "ik denk zooals mijnheer" zei koenraad
0.018182, "maar waar haalt hij die millioenen van daan" vroeg ned land daarop kon ik geen antwoord geven ik ging na het ontbijt naar den salon en zette mij aan het werk ik bleef tot vijf uur zitten schrijven ik het aan mijn lichaamstoestand moest toeschrijven wist ik niet doch ik voelde op dat oogenblik een 0.018519, groote hitte zoo zelfs dat ik mijn bovenkleed moest uitdoen ik begreep er niets van want wij waren op geen hooge breedte en bovendien kon de nautilus die op vrij groote diepte voer geen hinder hebben van hooge temperatuur ik keek eens op den manometer deze wees een diepte van twintig meter waar dus0.111111,  de warmte van den dampkring niet meer kon doordringen
0.038462, "hier het" zei de kapitein terwijl hij het mij op een kaart van den archipel aanwees "gij ziet dat ik er de nieuwe eilandjes heb opgezet"
0.076926, "wij kunnen niet langer dit kokend water blijven" zei ik tot den kapitein
0.038462, ik dacht er toen aan dat zoo ned land een dezer streken uitgekozen om te vluchten wij zeker niet levend uit deze vuurzee zouden gekomen zijn
0.250000, "zeer slecht" antwoordde ik
0.500000, "zijn bankier"
0.100000, "dan zal ik u een merkwaardigen tocht voorstellen mijnheer aronnax"
0.500000, "welken kapitein"
0.020408, de kapitein stapte zonder aarzelen voort tusschen het doolhof van steenen die den bodem van den atlantischen oceaan bedekten hij kende dien somberen weg hij dien zonder twijfel dikwijls bewandeld en kon er niet verdwalen ik volgde hem met onwankelbaar vertrouwen hij scheen mij toe een der geesten d0.018868, er zee te zijn en als hij voor mij uitging bewonderde ik zijn hooge gestalte die als een zwart beeld tegen den lichten gezichteinder afstak het uur na middernacht wij waren de onderste helling van den berg genaderd maar om dien te beklimmen moesten wij ons langs moeilijk begaanbare wegen door een d0.020834, icht bosch wagen het een bosch van doode boomen zonder bladeren zonder sap boomen die door het water waren gedood en waarboven hier en daar reusachtige dennen uitstaken het als 't ware een kolendomein waarin de verkoolde boomen overeind stonden omdat ze den gedeeltelijk losgewoelden grond nog vastg0.020409, eworteld zaten en wier takjes als fijn knipwerk van zwart papier tegen het heldere water juist waren afgeteekend men stelle zich een woud den harz tegen een berghelling voor doch het water verzonken de paden waren met wier en allerlei zeeplanten volgegroeid en daartusschen wemelde het van dieren ik0.022222,  klom tegen de rots op doch moest telkens uitstekende wortels heenstappen en zeeplanten scheuren die mij den weg dreven tusschen de boomtakken hingen terwijl ik een heirleger van visschen verschrikt opjoeg die tusschen de takken door wegzwommen meegesleept door de schoonheid van dit tooneel voelde 0.111111, ik geen afgematheid meer ik volgde mijn onvermoeiden gids
0.019608, koenraad trad binnen ik vertelde hem onzen nachtelijken tocht en daar de wanden geopend waren kon hij nog een gedeelte zien van dit verdronken land de nautilus voer namelijk tien meter boven de vlakte van atlantis zij bewoog zich als een ballon die door den wind boven weilanden wordt voortgestuwd m0.020408, aar beter zou het zijn te zeggen dat wij den salon zaten als den waggon van een sneltrein het eerste wat onder onze oogen voorbijsnelde waren de phantastisch gevormde rotsen de doode boomen wier onbeweeglijke vormen ons onder water toegrijnsden verder de met een tapijt van zeeanemonen bedekte steen0.055556, klompen en vreemd gevormde blokken lava die bewezen met welk een woede de vulkanische uitbarstingen hadden plaats gehad
0.018868, ik zou zeker nog lang voor het raam de schoonheden van de zee en den hemel zijn blijven bewonderen als de wanden niet werden dichtgeschoven op dit oogenblik de nautilus tot aan den loodrechten rotswand genaderd hoe hij manoeuvreerde kon ik niet raden ik ging naar mijn kamer het vaartuig lag stil ik0.017857,  sliep met het vaste voornemen om na weinige uren weer op te staan doch het den volgenden morgen acht uur toen ik den salon kwam de manometer deed mij zien dat de nautilus op de oppervlakte der zee dreef bovendien hoorde ik op het plat loopen doch ik voelde door de deining der golven geen slingeren0.027778, voordat ik den inwendigen vorm van deze verbazend groote grot nauwkeuriger onderzocht voor ik mij zelven afvroeg dat het werk der natuur van menschenhanden trad ik op den kapitein toe en vroeg hem waar wij waren
0.018868, wij begonnen te klimmen de helling werd hoe langer zoo steiler en de paden hoe langer zoo nauwer soms waren er diepe spleten den grond waarover wij moesten heenspringen dan moesten wij weer om ver uitstekende en overhangende rotsblokken heen wij kropen soms op de op den buik voort maar met hulp van0.090909,  koenraaads behendigheid en neds kracht kwamen wij alle hinderpalen te boven
0.018868, gedurende dit gedeelte der reis voeren wij soms dagen lang aan de oppervlakte der zee zij als verlaten wij zagen slechts nu en dan een zeilschip dat voor bevracht koers zette naar de kaap de goede hoop eens werden wij vervolgd door de sloepen van een walvischvaarder die ons zonder twijfel aanzag vo0.019231, or een reusachtigen walvisch van groote waarde maar kapitein nemo wilde die wakkere zeelieden hun tijd en moeite niet laten verliezen en eindigde de jacht met onder water te duiken dit voorval scheen ned land bijzonder belang te boezemen ik geloof niet dat ik mij bedrieg als ik zeg dat de amerikaan0.055556,  er spijt gevoelde dat onze metalen huid niet door een der harpoenen van die visschers doodelijk werd getroffen
0.027778, "ten anderen omdat als de zuurstof een levensbehoefte men weet dat de zeewater opgeloste hoeveelheid zuurstof de diepte toeneemt plaats van te verminderen en dat de grootere waterdruk de diepte de samenpersing daarvan de hand werkt"
0.333333, "waarom" vroeg ik
0.047619, "ik begrijp u" zei ik "maar hoewel die berekening gemakkelijk te maken kan zij toch slechts een zeer onzekere uitkomst opleveren"
0.200000, koenraad het juiste woord gekozen
0.019231, "komaan ik zelf heb '65 dus nu derdehalf jaar geleden bij groenland een walvisch gevangen met een harpoen zijn lichaam die een walvischvaarder aan de behringstraat er gegooid nu vraag ik eens hoe het mogelijk dat een walvisch die aan de westkust van amerika gewond wordt zich aan de oostkust laat do0.055556, oden als hij niet om kaap hoorn om de kaap de goede hoop en den evenaar heen gezwommen"

0.058824, "goed ned" zei ik en dezelfde woorden als de amerikaan gebruikende vroeg ik "moet ik je gelooven"
0.125001, ned zag mij aan met een schalksch gelaat
0.055556, ned land luisterde niet naar mij de walvisch kwam steeds nader ned verslond het dier met de oogen
0.040000, "nou dan mijnheer" vroeg de amerikaan "mag ik er eens jacht op maken al het alleen maar om mijn ambacht van harpoenier niet te vergeten"
0.021739, "ik gelijk met te zeggen dat zonder eens den mensch mee te tellen de walvisschen genoeg natuurlijke vijanden hebben deze zullen hier heel spoedig met een sterke tegenpartij te doen hebben ziet gij daar op acht kilometer onder den wind mijnheer aronnax die zwarte beweegbare punten"
0.020408, "elk zijn meug" antwoordde kapitein nemo terwijl hij ned land strak aankeek ik vreesde dat deze zich soms tot eenige drift liet vervoeren wat noodlottige gevolgen kunnen hebben maar zijn toorn werd afgeleid door het gezicht van een walvisch waar de nautilus op dat oogenblik tegen aandreef het dier 0.023256, aan den beet der potvisschen niet kunnen ontsnappen ik herkende den zuidelijken walvisch aan den afgeplatten geheel zwarten kop hij van den noordkaper noordelijken walvisch onderscheiden door de aaneenhechting der zeven halswervels en doordat hij twee ribben meer heeft dan zijn noordelijke natuurge0.020000, noot de ongelukkige walvisch lag op zijde de potvisschen hadden hem verscheiden wonden den buik toegebracht hij dood een jong dat door de moeder niet kunnen beschermd worden tegen den moorddadigen aanval hing nog aan zijn gescheurde vinnen door den open bek liep het zeewater en maakte tusschen de b0.111111, aarden binnenstroomend een geluid als de branding der zee

0.058827, "moeilijk kapitein want het jaargetijde reeds te vergevorderd om te verwachten dat het ijs nog zal losgaan"
0.500000, "niets kapitein"
0.125000, "wel mogelijk maar dan komt gij niet terug"
0.027028, de mist trok niet op om elf uur de zon nog niet doorgekomen ik maakte mij daar ongerust want zonder zon waren geen waarnemingen mogelijk hoe zouden wij toch nauwkeurig kunnen weten wij de zuidpool bereikt hadden

0.166667, "eindelijk liggen wij recht" riep ik
0.142857, "als het gedaan is" mompelde ned land
0.083333, "ja" zei ik "het een prachtig schouwspel dunkt je ook niet ned"
0.037037, toen ik zoo sprak wilde ik kalmer schijnen dan ik het inderdaad echter ging de nautilus hoe langer hoe sneller achterwaarts en sleepte ons razende vaart mee

0.142857, "mogen de wanden van den salon open"
0.018519, op dat oogenblik kwam de kapitein die het werk bestierde doch zelf ook meewerkte langs mij heen ik stiet hem aan den arm en wees hem op de muren onzer gevangenis aan stuurboordzijde de muur tot op vier meter van den nautilus genaderd "wij gingen naar binnen en trokken onze scaphanders uit waarna ik0.200002,  met hem den salon ging
0.062500, "o" riep hij uit "als mijn nautilus aan die drukking weerstand kon bieden zonder verpletterd worden"
0.125000, "welnu" vroeg ik daar ik hem niet begreep
0.019231, op zijn bevel werd het vaartuig verlicht dat te zeggen door de zwaarte te verminderen toen het door het uitpompen van eenig water uit de vergaarbakken dreef bracht hij het boven de groote opening die men juist volgens den omtrek van den nautilus gehakt toen de vergaarbakken daarna weer vol werden g0.026316, epompt zakte het vaartuig juist de opening op dat oogenblik kwam de geheele bemanning weer binnen boord en werden de dubbele deuren gesloten de nautilus rustte toen op een ijskorst die nauwelijks een meter dikte en overal doorboord
0.017241, "niet al te veel om u de waarheid te zeggen ik heb wel een paar monden vol lucht willen hebben maar ik geloof dat ik mij er weldra aan zou hebben gewend bovendien zag ik dat mijnheer flauw viel en ik dus niet den minsten lust om adem te halen mijn ademhaling werd daardoor als het ware belet"

0.018868, toen al ons lijden vergeten en de herinnering aan onze gevangenschap werd uit onzen geest als weggevaagd wij dachten enkel aan de toekomst kapitein nemo verscheen noch den salon noch op het plat de eerste stuurman nam dagelijks de hoogte der zon en teekende die op de kaart aan waardoor ik geheel op0.028571,  de hoogte bleef van de richting van den nautilus dien avond werd het tot mijn groote tevredenheid duidelijk dat wij door den atlantischen oceaan naar het noorden gingen ik vertelde dit aan ned en koenraad
0.076923, "o mijnheer kan mij vrij gelooven" antwoordde koen "ik zal mij duchtig wreken"
0.019231, den volgenden dag 12 april naderde de nautilus de amerikaansche kust bij de monding der maroni op die hoogte hielden zich groote troepen zeekoeien op die zooals ik aan mijn beide makkers vertelde door de natuur als met opzet deze streken geplaatst waren om de onderzeesche weiden af te grazen en daa0.100000, rdoor de te groote opeenhooping van zeegras tegen te gaan

0.020833, den 20sten april waren wij weer op een gemiddelde diepte van 1500 meter de lucaische eilanden lagen toen het dichtst bij ons zij liggen daar als een hoop steenen aan de oppervlakte der zee daar verhieven zich hooge onderzeesche klippen rechte rotswanden op breeden grondslag waartusschen zwarte afgr0.038462, onden lagen welker diepte ons electrisch licht zelfs niet kon doordringen die rotsen waren met reusachtige zeeplanten bedekt die een wereld van titans te huis behoorden

0.076923, "kom wie heeft daar ooit aan geloofd voor den duivel" riep de amerikaan

0.019231, op het oogenblik dat wij de een op den ander drongen om het plat te bereiken kronkelden twee andere voelarmen door de lucht grepen den man die den kapitein stond en slingerden hem met onweerstaanbaar geweld de hoogte de kapitein stiet een kreet uit en sprong naar buiten wij ijlden hem na
0.062500, "ik u dit nog schuldig" zei de kapitein tot den amerikaan ned boog zonder te antwoordden
0.058824, de ontvangst niet zeer aanmoedigend maar ik besloten alles aan te hooren ten einde alles te beantwoorden
0.019231, dood moede en bijna machteloos kroop ik langzaam naar het luik ik opende het en ging naar den salon toen kreeg de storm zijn grootste kracht het onmogelijk op de beenen te blijven staan kapitein nemo kwam tegen middernacht binnen ik hoorde dat de vergaarbakken vol water werden gepompt en de nautilu0.125000, s zonk langzaam onder het vlak der zee
0.020000, ik heb gezegd dat de nautilus oostwaarts gedreven het zou nauwkeuriger geweest zijn als ik gezegd noordoostwaarts gedurende eenige dagen dwaalde ons vaartuig dan op dan onder de golven terwijl er op zee een mist hing die voor de scheepvaart zoo gevaarlijk deze mist ontstaat door het smelten van het0.019608,  ijs waardoor de dampkring zeer vochtig blijft hoeveel schepen zijn er deze streken niet vergaan terwijl zij de onzekere lichten aan de kust opzochten welke rampen werden niet door die dikke misten veroorzaakt hoe menig schip stiet op een klip omdat de bemanning door het gebulder van den wind de br0.045455, anding niet hoorde hoeveel schepen stieten niet tegen elkander hoewel zij de lichten ontstoken hadden en aanhoudend door schel fluiten klokluiden waarschuwden
