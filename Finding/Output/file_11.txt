0.018182, de oester geopend de kapitein ging er heen en zette er zijn dolk tusschen om de schelpen te beletten zich te sluiten daarop lichtte hij met de hand het vliesachtig bekleedsel op dat het dier omhulde daar zag ik tusschen de plooien van het vleesch een vrije parel zoo groot als een kokosnoot haar ron0.020000, de vorm volmaakte zuiverheid en schoone glans maakten die parel tot een zeldzame kostbaarheid van onschatbare waarde door nieuwsgierigheid geprikkeld stak ik de hand uit om haar te grijpen te betasten te wegen maar de kapitein hield mij tegen schudde met het hoofd ten teeken van afkeuring en trok d0.090909, en dolk snel tusschen de schelpen uit die zich onmiddellijk besloten
0.019608, nog zie ik de houding van kapitein nemo een weinig ineengebogen wachtte hij met bewonderenswaardige koelbloedigheid het vreeselijk dier af en toen het zich op hem wilde werpen sprong de kapitein verbazend vlug op zijde vermeed den schok en stak het beest zijn dolk den buik dit slechts een begin wan0.142857, t nu ving een ontzettende strijd aan
0.038462, toen wij aan boord waren ontdeden wij ons met behulp der matrozen van de zware koperen helmen het eerste woord van den kapitein voor den amerikaan
0.090909, "het een wederdienst kapitein" antwoordde deze "ik nog bij u schuld"
0.020408, "welnu dan zullen wij den atlantischen oceaan bezoeken dien wij nog niet kennen maar zeg eens vriend ned verveelt u dan die onderzeesche reis hebt gij dan reeds overgenoeg van het steeds afwisselend schouwspel der onderzeesche wonderen wat mij aangaat ik zal met groote spijt een reis zien eindigen 0.125000, waartoe zoo weinig menschen de gelegenheid zijn geweest"
0.020833, den volgenden dag dreef de nautilus het gezicht van aden dat op een klein schiereiland ligt een soort van ontoegankelijk gibraltar waar de engelschen forten hebben gebouwd nadat zij het 1839 bezet hadden ik zag de achthoekige minarets der stad die volgens den geschiedschrijver edrisi vroeger de rij0.125000, kste en meest handeldrijvende stapelplaats der geheele kust
0.022728, de roode zee de beroemde golf der bijbelsche overlevering die nooit door regen verfrischt wordt waarin geen enkele stroom zijn water uitstort die door gestadige uitdamping onophoudelijk water verliest zoodat zonder toevoer uit de indische zee de hoogte jaarlijks anderhalven meter verminderen zou zo0.020408, nderlinge golf dus die wanneer zij als een meer geheel door het land ingesloten misschien volkomen zou uitdrogen zij verschilt dit opzicht dus geheel van de naburige kaspische en doode wier peil slechts zooveel door verdamping verlaagt als de massa water bedraagt die er door de rivieren wederom wor0.500000, dt ingebracht
0.020408, visschen waren er zeer talrijk sommige soorten zeer merkwaardig die welke door den nautilus met haak en lijn werden gevangen bijv de rog waaronder de gemarmerde met blauwachtige vlekken en dubbel getanden staart die met zilverkleurigen rug die met een puntstaart en vinnen ter grootte van een paar m0.025641, eter de tandelooze de haaiachtige en kraakbeenachtige tot de familie der roggen behoorende voorts koffervisschen (osiraciou) waaronder de drommedaris met een bultvormig uitwas uitloopende een omgebogen stekel van anderhalven voet lengte ook nog palingen met zilverkleurigen staart blauwachtigen rug 0.083334, en bruine borstvinnen met grijs omboord lipvisschen en een menigte andere zeedieren
0.034483, de kapitein gaf geen antwoord na eenige minuten zwijgens hernam hij "gij spraakt van de meening der oude geschiedschrijvers de gevaren waarmee de vaart de roode zee vergezeld gaat"
0.023810, "welnu kapitein wat de ouden niet hebben durven ondernemen de verbinding tusschen de beide waardoor de weg van marseille naar 9000 kilometer korter zal worden dat heeft de lesseps gedaan en binnen kort zal hij afrika tot een groot eiland gemaakt hebben"
0.027778, ned land's oogen schitterden van begeerte op het zien van dit dier zijn hand scheen gereed om het te harpoenen men zou zelfs gezegd hebben dat hij zee wilde springen om het zijn element te bestrijden
0.018519, op dat oogenblik kwamen zeven mannen van de equipage zwijgend en onverschillig als altijd op het plat een van hen droeg een harpoen en een lijn zooals de walvischvaarders gebruiken de sloep werd zee gebracht zes roeiers namen plaats op de banken en de zevende ging aan het roer zitten ned koen en ik0.200000,  namen op een achterbank plaats
0.125000, "neen mijnheer maar ik wensch u goede vangst"
0.018519, de matrozen begonnen weer te roeien en de stuurman richtte de boot naar het drijvende vaatje toen dit opgevischt begonnen wij het dier weer te vervolgen dit kwam van tijd tot tijd boven om adem te halen de wond het niet verzwakt want het zwom bijzonder snel de sloep door krachtige armen geroeid vlo0.028571, og den dugong achterna verscheidene malen naderden wij hem tot op eenige vademen en de amerikaan hield zich gereed om hem te treffen maar het beest dook dan plotseling zoodat het onmogelijk het te bereiken
0.066667, "zeg eens mijnheer de professor" zet hij "zoudt gij mij gaarne den stuurstoel willen vergezellen"
0.017544, den volgenden dag 12 februari kwam de nautilus bij het krieken van den dag weer boven ik haastte mij naar het plat op drie kilometer zuidwaarts van ons zag ik den vagen omtrek der kust van pelusium een stroom ons van de eene zee naar de andere gevoerd maar die tunnel reeds moeielijk om af te varen 0.166667, moest onmogelijk op te varen zijn
0.020408, de amerikaan zweeg eenige oogenblikken toen sloeg hij de armen elkander en zei "eerlijk gesproken heb ik geen berouw van die onderzeesche reis ik ben mijn schik ze meegemaakt te hebben maar nu ik haar gemaakt heb moet er ook een einde aan komen zoo denk ik er over"
0.142857, "maar wat verwacht gij dan" vroeg ned
0.100000, "en wat denkt vriend koen er van" vroeg ned land
0.058824, "goed ned loer dus op die gelegenheid maar vergeet niet dat een mislukking ons verderf zou zijn"
0.333333, "graag mijnheer aronnax"
0.250000, "kent gij hem kapitein"
0.333333, "waarom niet mijnheer"
0.018182, de kist werd goed gesloten en de kapitein schreef er een adres op met grieksche letters toen dit gedaan drukte hij op een knop die door middel van een draad gemeenschap met het verblijf der equipage er verschenen acht man die niet zonder veel moeite de kist uit den salon droegen toen hoorde ik dat 0.125001, zij die met takels de groote trap optrokken
0.022727, "neen dat zou onvoorzichtig zijn" antwoordde nemo bedaard een bevel werd gegeven de nautilus zette zich weer beweging en verwijderde zich van dien oven waarbij hij het niet langer ongestraft kunnen uithouden een kwartier later haalden wij weer adem aan het oppervlak der zee
0.024390, den volgenden dag 16 februari verlieten wij dit gedeelte der zee dat tusschen rhodus en soms een diepte van 3000 meter heeft en de nautilus cerigo rechts latende liggen verlieten wij den griekschen archipel na om kaap matapan te zijn heengevaren
0.022727, "dat waar maar ik herhaal het koen dit verschijnsel zal niet plaats hebben de kracht der onderaardsche werking vermindert voortdurend de vulkanen die vroeger tijdperken zoo talrijk waren dooven langzamerhand uit de inwendige warmte verflauwt de temperatuur der onderste aardlagen daalt eeuw op eeuw 0.071434, vrij merkbaar en dit ten nadeele van onze aarde want die warmte haar leven"
0.022727, daar vertoonde zich op een rotsachtigen en vulkanischen bodem een geheele flora met de schoonste schitterendste en veelkleurigste gewassen ook bewonderde hij er de tallooze week en schaaldieren die er zich tusschen vertoonden en met welker rangschikking klassen en orden hij zich bijzonder vermaakte0.019608, "dat waar" antwoordde ned "maar dat moet men wagen de vrijheid wel wat waard bovendien de boot sterk en eenige kilometers met een goeden wind beteekenen niets wie weet wij morgen geen honderd kilometer ver zee zijn als de omstandigheden ons begunstigen zullen wij tusschen tien en elf uur ergens aan0.083334,  wal stappen dood zijn god behoede u dus en tot van avond"
0.018182, tweemaal ging ik naar den salon om het kompas te raadplegen ten einde te zien de nautilus de kust bleef naderen er zich van verwijderde maar neen de nautilus bleef altijd bij de portugeesche kust hij voer steeds naar het noorden wij moesten er dus partij van trekken en ons voor de vlucht gereed hou0.111111, den mijn bagage niet zwaar niets dan mijn aanteekeningen
0.029412, men zou de geschiedenis van zijn eigen land volmaakt goed kunnen kennen doch de omstandigheden waarin ik verkeerde met een verwarden geest en een berooid hoofd er toch geen enkel woord van kunnen vertellen
0.066667, "welnu" hernam kapitein nemo "hebt gij mijn vraag gehoord kent gij de geschiedenis van spanje"
0.023810, "het jaar te voren hadden holland oostenrijk en engeland den haag een verdrag gesloten om aan philips v de spaansche kroon te ontnemen ten einde deze een aartshertog op het hoofd te plaatsen wien men voorloopig den naam van karel iii gaf
0.055556, "ik wist alleen" antwoordde ik "dat men het zilver dat het zeewater opgelost op twee millioen centenaars schat"
0.021277, echter nam de rosse schijn die ons leidde toe en vertoonde zich reeds met vlammen aan den gezichteinder de aanwezigheid van dien vuurhaard onder water maakte mij de hoogste mate nieuwsgierig het een uitstrooming van electriciteit zou ik een natuurlijk verschijnsel zien waarvan de geleerden nog niet0.018869, s wisten zou en deze gedachte schoot mij door het hoofd 's menschen hand dit vuur zichtbaar zijn blies hij dien brand aan zou ik de diepte wellicht makkers vrienden van kapitein nemo ontmoeten die even vreemd als hij leefden en die hij ging opzoeken zou ik daaronder misschien een volkplanting van b0.021739, annelingen aantreffen die de ellende der aarde moede de diepten van den oceaan de onafhankelijkheid gezocht en gevonden hadden al die dwaze ongerijmde denkbeelden kwamen mij voor den geest en die gemoedstemming onophoudelijk verbaasd door de wonderen die voor mijn oogen voorbijgingen zou ik niet ve0.052632, rwonderd geweest zijn als ik de diepte der zee een van die onderzeesche steden ontdekt waarvan kapitein nemo droomde
0.022222, welk een gedachte trof mij atlantis het oude meropis van theopompus het atlantis van plato het vaste land dat ontkend werd door origenes porphyrius jamblichus d'anville maltebrun en von humboldt die deze verdwijning onder de sprookjes rekenden doch waaraan geloof geslagen werd door posiodonius plin0.020833, ius ammianus marcellinus tertullianus engel sherer tournefort buffon en d'avezac ik het daar onder mijn oogen zooals het de onwedersprekelijke sporen nog droeg van de ramp welke het getroffen dit dan het verzwolgen land dat vroeger gelegen buiten de grenzen van europa libye en de kolommen van hercu0.062500, les waar het machtig volk der atlanten leefde waartegen het oude griekenland zijn eerste oorlogen voerde
0.021739, terwijl deze zonderlinge streken onder ons electrisch licht zichtbaar waren verhaalde ik aan koenraad de geschiedenis van de atlanten ik sprak hem de oorlogen van die heldhaftige volken en behandelde het vraagstuk omtrent het bestaan van atlantis als iemand die geen twijfel meer koestert maar koenr0.058824, aad afgetrokken en hoorde mij ternauwernood aan spoedig echter begreep ik zijn onverschilligheid voor deze geschiedkundige vraagstukken
0.018182, ik ging naar het luik het open maar plaats van het helder daglicht zoo als ik verwachtte omringde mij dikke duisternis waar waren wij ik mij bedrogen het nog nacht neen geen enkele ster schitterde en de nacht niet zoo volslagen donker ik wist niet wat er van te denken toen ik iemand hoorde zeggen
0.021739, de grond verhief zich langzamerhand naarmate wij ons van den oever verwijderden en wij waren weldra door een lange en bochtige helling gekomen waar wij langzamerhand hooger konden klimmen maar wij moesten voorzichtig voortgaan tusschen die losliggende steenblokken en onze voet gleed daarbij nu en d0.034483, an uit op de stukken veldspaat en kwarts de vulkanische natuur van deze ontzettend groote grot werd ons hoe langer hoe meer bevestigd ik deed het mijn makkers opmerken
0.018868, hier een prachtige grot mijn makkers en ik kregen lust ons op het fijne zand uit te strekken het vuur de wanden met schitterend glazuur bedekt ned land betastte ze als wilde hij onderzoeken hoe dik zij wel waren ik kon een glimlach niet onderdrukken ons gesprek viel toen weer op zijn eeuwigdurende 0.019231, plannen om te ontvluchten en zonder zijn hoop al te zeer te voeden kon ik toch deze veronderstelling maken dat namelijk kapitein nemo slechts naar het zuiden gevaren om zijn voorraad sodium te vernieuwen ik hoopte dus dat hij nu weer naar de kusten van europa amerika zou varen waardoor de amerikaan0.076923,  dus de gelegenheid zou zijn zijn mislukte poging met beteren uitslag te hervatten
0.022222, de visschen die ik met koenraad gedurende dit gedeelte onzer reis opmerkte verschilden weinig van die wij reeds vroeger gezien hadden de voornaamste waren eenige exemplaren van de vreeselijke afdeeling kraakbeenachtige dieren die niet minder dan twee en dertig soorten bevat gestreepte haaien van vi0.019231, jf meter lang en met platten kop breeder dan het lichaam en een ronden staart op den rug hebben zij overlangs zeven breede evenwijdige zwarte strepen en dan grijze haaien met slechts een rugvin er kwamen ook groote zeehonden voorbij en dat wel van de meest verslindende soort men behoeft alle verhal0.017544, en van visschers niet te gelooven doch ziehier eenige staaltjes van hetgeen zij vertellen het lichaam van een van die dieren heeft men den kop van een buffel en een geheel kalf gevonden een ander twee konijnen en een matroos met kleeren en al een ander een soldaat met den sabel de hand en nog een a0.026316, nder een ruiter met zijn paard men behoeft aan dat alles geen geloof te hechten doch zeker het dat geen van die dieren zich de netten van den nautilus lieten vangen ik dus hunne vraatzucht niet kon nagaan
0.020000, dagen lang hielden troepen bevallige en dartelende dolfijnen ons gezelschap zij zwommen met troepjes van vijf zes en joegen de andere visschen na evenals een troep wolven het veld overigens zijn zij niet minder vraatzuchtig dan de zeehonden als ik ten minste geloof moet slaan aan het verhaal van ee0.052632, n hoogleeraar te kopenhagen die verzekert dertien walrussen en vijftien robben de maag van een dolfijn gevonden te hebben
0.020408, de nautilus zonk nog lager niettegenstaande de vreeselijke drukking die hij onderging ik voelde de stalen platen de voegen trillen de steunbouten bogen zich de geheele romp kraakte de glazen van den salon schenen onder dien druk naar binnen te buigen en het krachtige vaartuig zou zeker bezweken zij0.058824, n als het geen weerstand kunnen bieden als een massief blok zooals de kapitein mij eenmaal verzekerd
0.016949, den nacht van 13 op 14 maart richtte de nautilus zich weer naar het zuiden ik dacht dat het vaartuig op de hoogte van kaap hoorn den steven naar het westen zou wenden om weer koers te zetten naar de stille zuidzee en aldus de onderzeesche reis om de aarde te eindigen doch dit gebeurde niet en het s0.029412, chip vervolgde den tocht naar zuidelijker streken waar wilde de kapitein toch heen naar de zuidpool dat onzinnig ik begon wezenlijk te gelooven dat de roekeloosheid van nemo de vrees van ned land rechtvaardigde
0.020833, sinds eenigen tijd sprak de amerikaan niet meer zijn ontvluchtingsplannen hij minder opmerkzaam geworden ik zag wel hoezeer hem die langdurige gevangenschap kwelde en ik begreep hoeveel toorn hij opkropte als hij den kapitein ontmoette blonk een dof vuur zijn oogen en ik vreesde altijd nog dat zijn0.100000,  woeste natuur hem tot het een ander uiterste zou drijven
0.333333, "juist" zei koenraad
0.021739, "bovendien" hernam hij "kan kapitein nemo toch niet altijd naar het zuiden gaan hij moet toch ophouden al het maar voor de ijsbank en dan moet hij toch naar meer bezochte terugkeeren dan het tijd genoeg om de plannen van ned land weer op te vatten"
0.023810, "wat mij aangaat" zei hij "ik heb ook eens een slag van een walvischstaart gehad maar mijn sloep dat spreekt mijn makkers en ik werden zes meter de hoogte gesmeten maar bij dien walvisch van mijnheer de mijne nog maar een kleintje"
0.250001, "omdat men het weet"
0.020408, "neen ned men weet het niet maar men veronderstelt het slechts en ziehier hoe men de gevolgtrekking maakt toen vier honderd jaar geleden de visschers voor het eerst jacht maakten op walvisschen waren die beesten grooter dan nu men veronderstelt dus vrij logisch dat de mindere grootte der tegenwoord0.029412, ige walvisschen daaraan toe te schrijven dat zij den tijd niet hebben om zich volkomen te ontwikkelen dat de oorzaak waarom buffon gezegd heeft dat deze dieren duizend jaar konden en moesten leven begrepen"
0.020833, de monsterachtige troep bleef steeds naderen zij hadden de walvisschen gezien en maakten zich gereed die aan te vallen men kon vooruit berekenen dat de potvisschen het zouden winnen niet alleen omdat zij beter gevormd zijn om hun weerlooze tegenstanders te overmeesteren maar ook omdat zij langer on0.018182, der water kunnen blijven zonder aan de oppervlakte te komen ademhalen het meer dan tijd om de walvisschen te hulp te komen de nautilus dook een weinig onder water koenraad ned en ik gingen aan de ramen van den salon zitten de kapitein begaf zich naar den stuurstoel om met zijn vaartuig als met een 0.071429, verdelgingstoestel te manoeuvreeren weldra voelde ik de schroef vlugger draaien en onze snelheid vermeerderen
0.019609, niettegenstaande zijn pogingen en krachtige middelen die hij inspande om het ijs te doen barsten de nautilus tot onbeweeglijkheid gedoemd als iemand niet verder kan hij gewoonlijk van de zaak af door terug te keeren maar hier het even onmogelijk om terug te keeren als om vooruit te komen want alle 0.018868, doorgangen waren achter ons gesloten en als ons vaartuig nog eenigen tijd stil bleef liggen zou het wel geheel en onder het ijs besloten zijn dit gebeurde zelfs tegen twee uur 's middags en het ijs vormde zich tegen de wanden van den nautilus met verbazende snelheid ik moet erkennen dat het gedrag 0.125000, van kapitein nemo op zijn minst genomen onvoorzichtig
0.031250, plotseling trof mij een denkbeeld dat mij het geheele plan van den kapitein openbaarde ik hem begrepen de wonderbare hoedanigheden van den nautilus zouden hem deze bovenmenschelijke onderneming wel te hulp komen
0.023810, "bijna mijnheer als deze ijsbergen meter boven water uitsteken dan zijn zij drie meter ingedompeld omdat nu deze ijsbergen niet hooger zijn dan honderd meter zijn zij maar drie honderd meter diep onder water en wat drie honderd meter voor den nautilus"
0.020833, het toen acht uur sedert vier uren reeds de lucht volgens de dagelijksche gewoonte ververscht moeten worden ik er echter niet veel last van hoewel kapitein nemo toch zijn toevlucht nog niet tot zijn luchtvergaarbakken genomen gedurende dien nacht mijn slaap onrustig hoop en vrees hielden mij beurte0.018868, lings gekluisterd ik stond verscheiden malen op en voelde aanhoudend dat de nautilus de dikte van het ijs onderzocht tegen drie uur 's morgens zag ik dat het ondervlak der ijsbank op vijftig meter diepte lag de bank ging dus langzamerhand een ijsveld de berg werd derhalve weer vlak ik hield mijn oo0.027027, gen op den manometer gevestigd wij rezen voortdurend schuine richting langs het ijsvlak dat het licht der electrische lantaarn schitterde de ijsbank nam van boven en van onderen telkens af zij werd van kilometer tot kilometer dunner
0.500000, de zuidpool
0.111111, "als gij maar wilt mijnheer" riep hij mij toe
0.076924, ik ging met koen aan land terwijl de beide mannen de sloep bleven
0.018519, toen ik weer bij den kapitein kwam lag hij op een stuk rots geleund en bekeek de lucht hij scheen ongeduldig en teleurgesteld maar wat daaraan te doen de stoutmoedige en veelvermogende man voerde geen bevel de zon zooals de zee het twaalf uur en nog de dagvorst zich geen oogenblik vertoond men kon 0.055556, zelfs niet zien waar hij ergens achter dit nevelgordijn verborgen weldra loste de mist zich de sneeuw op
0.200000, "het zijn zeekalven en robben"
0.166667, "neen mijn vriend dat zijn zeedieren"
0.250000, "zij vechten en spelen"
0.019231, de vergaarbakken waren vol water en de nautilus zonk langzamerhand naar beneden op een diepte van 350 meter hield hij stil de schroef begon te werken en wij stevenden met een snelheid van vijftien kilometer het uur naar het noorden tegen den avond dreven wij reeds onder de onmetelijke ijsbank uit v0.020000, oorzichtigheid waren de ramen van den salon gesloten want de nautilus kon wel eens tegen een drijvend ijsblok stooten ik bracht dien dag dus door met mijn aanteekeningen het net te schrijven mijn geest nog vervuld van de wonderen der pool zonder moeite gevaar hadden wij dit ontoegankelijk punt bere0.019608, ikt alsof wij er een effen spoorbaan waren heengereden en nu keerden wij inderdaad terug moest ik mij nogmaals op dergelijke verrassingen voorbereiden ik dacht het wel want het aantal der onderzeesche wonderen niet te tellen sedert vijf en een halve maand dat wij aan boord waren hadden wij 14000 ki0.023256, lometer afgelegd en hoeveel zonderlings wonderbaarlijks vreeselijks die reis reeds niet opgeleverd de jacht de bosschen van crespo de stranding de torresstraat het koralen kerkhof de parelvisscherij bij ceylon de arabische tunnel de vulkanische verschijnselen van santorino de schatten de baai van v0.050000, igo het verdwenen atlantis de zuidpool dien nacht stonden mij al die zaken telkens mijn droomen weer voor den geest
0.035714, ik hoorde voetstappen en het geluid van stemmen doch de kapitein verscheen niet op het oogenblik dat ik den salon wilde verlaten kwamen ned land en koenraad binnen
0.023256, "door een speling der natuur niet door menschelijke onbekwaamheid er bij onze vaart geen enkele fout begaan doch men kan de wetten van het evenwicht niet tegengaan men kan zich wel tegen de menschelijke wetten maar niet tegen die van de natuur verzetten"
0.021739, "een ontzaglijk ijsblok een heele ijsberg heeft zich omgekeerd wanneer de ijsbergen van onder door het water door herhaalde schokken worden ondermijnd dan rijst hun zwaartepunt en kunnen zij omkantelen dit nu gebeurd een van die ijsgevaarten heeft bij zijn kanteling tegen den nautilus gestooten daa0.028572, rna langs liet vaartuig heen gegleden doch heeft toen het na den val weer begon te rijzen het schip met onweerstaanbare kracht naar boven geduwd wij zitten nog eenigermate vast en liggen daarom op zijde"
0.023256, de kapitein ging heen en ik bemerkte weldra dat men de stijgende beweging van den nautilus op zijn bevel doen ophouden hij zou ook weldra tegen den onderkant van de ijsbank zijn aangestooten en het beter om het vaartuig vrij te laten drijven
0.025641, ik liep gedurende eenige oogenblikken van den salon naar de bibliotheek heen en weer mijn makkers zaten zwijgend te peinzen ik viel op een rustbank neer en nam een boek de hand waar ik slechts werktuiglijk een oog wierp
0.019231, er verliepen eenige uren ik zag dikwijls naar de instrumenten die aan den wand hingen de manometer wees aan dat de nautilus voortdurend op een diepte van 300 meter bleef het kompas dat hij steeds zuidwaarts voer de log dat hij met een snelheid van twintig kilometer het uur achteruitging een snelhei0.038462, d die zulk een nauw vaarwater buitensporig maar kapitein nemo wist dat hij zich niet te zeer kon haasten en dat minuten voor hem eeuwen waren
0.090909, "ja mijnheer de ijsberg heeft zich omgekeerd en alle uitgangen gestopt"
0.029412, "ja mijnheer wij zijn een betrekkelijk kleine ruimte opgesloten zouden stroomen kokend water die de pompen van den nautilus voortdurend kunnen aanvoeren de temperatuur niet genoegzaam kunnen doen stijgen om bevriezing tegen te houden"
0.025000, den volgenden dag 27 maart een dikte van zes meter weggehakt wij moesten nog door vier meter heen dus nog 48 uren werken den nautilus kon de lucht niet ververscht worden zoodat het dien dag hoe langer hoe benauwder werd
0.020833, daar onze toestand het vaartuig ondraaglijk trokken wij haastig en tevreden onze scaphanders aan om op onze beurt aan het werk te gaan de houweelslagen weerklonken op het ijs onze armen werden moede de handen deden ons pijn doch wat beteekende dit wij ademden versche lucht wij ademden
0.066667, ik kon geen antwoord geven ik greep hem bij de hand en drukte die onwillekeurig
0.018868, half liggend half zittend op een rustbank de bibliotheek stikte ik bijna mijn gelaat paars mijn lippen waren blauw al mijn krachten verlamd ik zag noch hoorde iets meer ik kon aan geen tijdruimte meer denken ik weet dus niet hoelang dit duurde maar ik begreep dat mijn doodstrijd begon ik voelde dat0.333333,  ik ging sterven
0.090909, waar de kapitein hij bezweken waren zijn makkers dood evenals hij
0.500000, hoofdstuk xli
0.083333, "een goede tijding" zei de eerste "maar waar gaat de nautilus heen"
0.071429, "welnu" zei de amerikaan "dan zullen wij hem dien tijd de hielen laten zien"
0.019608, wat ik bv hier bij de antillen op tien meter onder de oppervlakte door de ramen van den salon nog een aantal bijzonderheden voor mijn oogen die ik mijn dagboek kon opteekenen allerhande soorten van vreemdsoortige en gedrochtelijke dieren wemelden daar door elkander en ik zou zeker nog veel meer gez0.052632, ien hebben als de nautilus niet naar de diepte gegaan en zich zelfs tot op 3500 meter laten zinken
0.052634, "neen" antwoordde ik "inktvisschen van zeer groote afmeting maar vriend ned heeft zich zeker vergist want ik zie niets"
0.200000, "zeer veel menschen vriend ned"
0.166667, "neen ned visschers en geleerden beiden"
0.142857, "heb jij dat gezien" vroeg de amerikaan
0.125001, "op st malo" antwoordde koenraad met onverstoorbare kalmte
0.200000, "neen de kerk" antwoordde koen
0.050000, "neen" antwoordde ik "een andere bisschop pontoppidam van bergen spreekt ook van een inktvisch waarop een regiment ruiterij kon manoeuvreeren"
0.333333, "juist" antwoordde ik
