0.021277, rechtvaardig onrechtvaardig beschuldigde men het monster van de verdwijning dier schepen de gemeenschap tusschen de verschillende tanden werd dank zij de vrees voor het gedrocht hoe langer hoe gevaarlijker geen wonder dus dat het publiek er zich mede bemoeide en op stelligen toon eischte dat de zee0.076923,  eindelijk het kostte wat het wilde van dit vervaarlijk dier zou bevrijd worden
0.142857, "koen" riep ik voor de derde maal

0.020833, op de kampanje gezeten praatten ned land en ik koetjes en kalfjes terwijl wij onze blikken die geheimzinnige zee lieten dwalen wier diepten tot nog toe voor den menschelijken blik ondoordringbaar waren gebleven ik bracht zeer natuurlijk het gesprek op den reusachtigen eenhoorn en ik ging de verschi0.032258, llende kansen van het al niet gelukken onzer onderneming na toen ik zag dat ned mij slechts liet praten zonder zelf iets te zeggen ging ik meer op den man af
0.022727, "vergeet niet" hernam ik "dat als zulk een dier bestaat als het de diepten van den oceaan bewoont als het eenige kilometers onder de oppervlakte der zee zwemmen kan dat het dan noodzakelijk een samenstel hebben moet welks kracht alle vergelijking te boven gaat"
0.333333, "drommels" zeide ned

0.111113, "stilte" beval de kapitein "het roer den wind achteruit"
0.037037, "misschien" antwoordde de kapitein "maar als het electrieke kracht bezit dan het gewis het verschrikkelijkste beest dat de schepper ooit gewrocht heeft daarom zal ik oppassen mijnheer"
0.047619, "laat ik hem maar eens op vier harpoenlengten kunnen naderen" voegde ned er bij "dan zal hij mij wel moeten aanhooren"

0.062500, "neen kapitein" antwoordde ned "want dat dier zal zich niet laten vangen dan als het wil"
0.200000, "ja kapitein" antwoordde de machinist
0.017241, "wij halen hem wij halen hem in" riep ned maar op het oogenblik dat hij wilde werpen zwom het dier vooruit met eene snelheid welke ik op niet minder dan dertig kilometer het uur schatte en zelfs toen wij ons maximum van snelheid bereikt hadden stak het den draak met het fregat door er om heen te zw0.142857, emmen een kreet van woede ontsnapte ons

0.166667, "zoo het ned het zijne ademhaling"
0.047619, "juist" antwoordde ned "wij hebben recht op een dubbel maal en wat mij aangaat ik zal aan beiden eer genoeg bewijzen"
0.045455, "om uit eene aardsche gevangenis te ontsnappen soms zeer moeilijk maar om uit eene onderzeesche gevangenis te ontkomen schijnt mij geheel onmogelijk"
0.071429, "maar als men cipier en oppassers er uit gooit" voegde ned land er bij
0.052633, "spreek mijnheer" antwoordde ik "ik stel mij voor dat dit eene voorwaarde welke elk eerlijk man zal kunnen aannemen"

0.020833, ik volgde den kapitein die door eene andere deur mij een der gangen van het schip bracht hij geleidde mij naar het voorste gedeelte en daar vond ik niet eene hut maar eene smaakvolle kamer met bed toilettafel en verschillende andere meubelen ik kon mijn gastheer slechts danken
0.043479, "juist mijnheer hij staat verbinding met het water welks drukking hij aanwijst zoodat ik daardoor weet op welke diepte mijn vaartuig zich beweegt"

0.027778, de nautilus scheen zich niet te bewegen het omdat wij vaste punten voor ons oog misten somwijlen echter vlogen strepen waters met buitengewone snelheid ons voorbij waardoor wij konden zien dat wij inderdaad zeer snel vooruitgingen
0.066667, "wat gaat u dat aan vriend ned" antwoordde koenraad "omdat gij ze toch niet kent"
0.019608, en daarop ontstond een soort van twistgesprek tusschen de beide vrienden want beiden kenden visschen maar ieder op verschillende wijze ned land kende er wel onderscheid tusschen doch koenraad wist er zooveel te meer van en nu hij de vriend van den harpoenier geworden kon hij niet dulden dat deze mi0.025641, nder wist dan hij daarom zeide hij "gij zijt een visschendooder mijn vriend een zeer handig visscher gij hebt eene groote menigte van die belangwekkende dieren gevangen maar ik wed dat gij niet weet hoe men ze klassen verdeelt"

0.166667, "maar hoe komen wij er uit"
0.020000, de kapitein liep vooruit en zijn makker volgde ons op eenige schreden afstands koen en ik bleven dicht bij elkander alsof wij door onze helmen heen met elkander hadden kunnen praten ik voelde niets meer van de zwaarte van kleederen schoeisel luchtbak helm waarin mijn hoofd ronddraaide als een amand0.022222, el haar bast al die voorwerpen verloren een gedeelte van hun gewicht gelijkstaande met de massa water welke zij verplaatsen zoodat ik gelegenheid om de voortreffelijkheid der wet van archimedes te ondervinden ik geen werkeloos lichaam maar genoot integendeel een betrekkelijk groote vrijheid mijne b0.020000, geen van de grassoorten welke den grond bedekten geen van de takken welke uit de struiken te voorschijn groeiden bochtig krom strekte zich horizontaal uit alles rees lijnrecht naar het zeeoppervlak geen sprietjes geen takjes zoo dun zij waren recht als ijzeren staven en draden het zeewier en het ri0.033334, et groeiden lijnrecht naar boven als ik ze met de hand op zijde duwde hernamen die planten onmiddellijk haar vorigen stand hier scheen het rijk van de rechtstandigheid te zijn

0.499996, florida sunderland
0.021278, tegen den avond verdween clermonttonnerre de verte en de richting van de nautilus veranderde merkbaar na op lengte den steenbokskeerkring even te hebben aangeraakt wendde zij zich wnw hoewel de zonnestralen krachtig neerschoten hadden wij geen hinder van de warmte daar de temperatuur op 30 40 meter0.111116,  onder water zich niet boven tien twaalf graad verhief
0.066667, op dat oogenblik vroeg mij kapitein nemo wat ik van de schipbreuk van la wist
0.017857, de kapitein keek mij met een zonderlingen blik aan en schudde met het hoofd dit duidelijk gezegd dat niets hem ooit zou dwingen om den voet weder op het land te zetten toen zeide hij "bovendien mijnheer aronnax de nautilus niet weg zij zal u nog de wonderen van den oceaan laten zien onze reis begin0.055556, t eerst en ik hoop nog zoo spoedig niet van de eer van uw gezelschap verstoken te worden"
0.034483, "en die kapitein gaat zijn ankers niet uitgooien om zich hieraf te brassen en zijne machine niet laten werken en alles doen om van die verwenschte klip te komen"
0.142857, "het tij immers voldoende" antwoordde koenraad bedaard
0.017857, den volgenden dag 5 januari werd de sloep losgemaakt en van het plat zee gewerkt twee man waren daarvoor genoeg de riemen lagen er en wij behoefden slechts plaats te nemen met bijlen en electrieke geweren bij ons roeiden wij om acht uur weg de zee vrij kalm een kleine bries woei van de landzijde ko0.019608, en en ik roeiden flink op en ned stuurde tusschen de klippen door de sloep gemakkelijk te sturen en schoot goed vooruit ned kon zijne vreugde niet bedwingen hij stelde zich aan als een gevangene die aan zijne cel ontsnapt en hij dacht er niet aan dat hij er weder moest
0.027778, "goed zoo mijnheer aronnax" antwoordde de amerikaan wiens tanden zoo scherp als een bijl schenen te zijn "maar ik zal zelfs een tijgerrib eten als er geen ander viervoetig dier op dit eiland te vinden is"
0.071429, "en zooveel te beter voor ons" antwoordde ned land "des te meer houden wij"
0.025001, "laat ons dan verder gaan" hernam ik "maar goed uit onze oogen zien want al schijnt het eiland onbewoond dan zouden er toch wel eens wezens op kunnen wonen die minder kiesch dan wij op het soort van wild waren"
0.071429, "ik begin waarachtig te begrijpen" hervatte de amerikaan "hoe pleizierig het menscheneten zijn moet"

0.018519, ned land zijn voorraad niet den steek willen laten en niettegenstaande het dreigende van het gevaar liep hij met zijn varken op den eenen en de kangoeroe's op den anderen schouder zoo hard als hij kon twee minuten waren wij op het strand onze provisie en onze wapens de sloep werpen die zee brengen 0.019231, en de riemen grijpen het werk van een oogenblik wij waren nog geen twee kabellengten ver toen honderd wilden met geschreeuw en gebaren tot aan het middel het water liepen ik keek eens hunne verschijning ook enige mannen van de nautilus op het plat zou tevoorschijn roepen maar neen het kolossale vaa0.333333, rtuig bleef verlaten
0.111111, "wat mij aangaat mijnheer ik heb overal wilden ontmoet"
0.019231, gedurende al den tijd dat het lage tij duurde zwierven de inboorlingen de nabijheid van de nautilus maar zij maakten geen geraas ik hoorde hen dikwijls het woord "assai" roepen en uit hunne gebaren begreep ik dat zij mij uitnoodigden om aan land te komen eene uitnoodiging welke ik meende te moeten 0.019608, weigeren dien dag verliet de sloep derhalve de nautilus niet tot groot verdriet van ned land die zijn voorraad niet kon volledig maken de handige amerikaan gebruikte zijn tijd om het vleesch klaar te maken dat hij van gueboroar medegebracht wat de wilden betreft die gingen tegen elf uur 's morgens 0.021277, weer naar land toen de toppen der koraalriffen bij het wassen van het tij onder de golven begonnen te verdwijnen doch ik zag dat hun aantal op het strand zeer toenam waarschijnlijk kwamen zij van de naburige eilanden en van nieuwguinea echter zag ik geen enkele prauw
0.019231, wij vischten ijverig gedurende twee uur doch zonder eenig zeldzaam stuk op te halen ons net telkens wel vol schelpen maar niets bijzonders alleen een stuk wat paarloesters en een dozijn kleine schildpadden die wij voor den kok bewaarden doch op 't oogenblik dat ik er het minst op verdacht kreeg ik 0.019608, een wonder liever gezegd eene natuurlijke misvorming te zien welke men zelden ontmoet koen het net weder uitgeworpen en haalde het met zeer gewone schelpen op toen hij mij plotseling de hand het net zag steken en er een schelp uithalen welke ik met een kreet van blijdschap de hoogte hief

0.200000, "het doodeenvoudig een purperolijf klasse
0.066667, "ja wel koen maar plaats van rechts naar links gedraaid te zijn deze juist omgekeerd"
0.018868, koen en ik waren dus verrukt op het gezicht van onzen schat en ik vatte het plan reeds op om er ons museum mede te verrijken toen een noodlottige steen door een inboorling geworpen het kostbare voorwerp koenraads hand stukken sloeg ik stiet een wanhopigen kreet uit koenraad greep mijn geweer en mik0.025000, te op den wilde die zijn slinger op tien meter van ons af nog de hand ik wilde hem tegenhouden doch het schot ging af en verbrijzelde den armband van amuletten welke om den arm van den papoea geslingerd zat
0.041667, onder anderen spraken wij de ligging van de nautilus die juist gestrand die zeestraat waar dumont d'urville op het punt geweest van te vergaan
0.020000, "de nautilus niet gestrand mijnheer" antwoordde de kapitein bedaard "de nautilus gemaakt om kalm op het water te liggen en ik zal al die moeilijke manoeuvres niet beginnen welke d'urville met zijn korvetten aanving om weder vlot te raken de astrolabe en de zijn vergaan doch mijn nautilus loopt geen0.045455,  gevaar morgen zal het hoogtij op het bepaalde uur het vaartuig oplichten en wij zullen onzen tocht door de zee kunnen voortzetten"
0.027027, den 14den januari waren wij tusschen alle klippen en eilanden door eindelijk weder volle zee de snelheid van de nautilus werd aanmerkelijk minder en zeer wispelturig hare bewegingen dreef zij dan eens onder dan op de zee
0.020000, ned land liet zijn doordringend oog de zee dwalen maar deze geheel verlaten de amerikaan zag niets aan den gezichteinder noch land noch schip er woei een stevige westewind en groote golven door dien bries opgedreven deden het schip vrij erg slingeren nadat de nautilus de lucht ververscht bleef zij 0.019608, op eene diepte van vijftien meter drijven zoodat zij elk geval spoedig weder aan de oppervlakte der zee verschijnen kon iets wat tegen de gewoonte dien dag verscheidene malen gebeurde dan ging de stuurman op het plat en sprak den gewonen volzin uit de kapitein verscheen niet van het scheepsvolk zag0.076923,  ik den strakken hofmeester die mij met zijne gewone nauwkeurigheid en stilzwijgendheid bediende

0.020000, bovendien bindt ons niets aan kapitein nemo hij weet dat wij den nautilus onmogelijk kunnen ontvluchten wij zijn zelfs niet op ons woord van eer gevangen geen belofte bindt ons aan hem wij zijn slechts gevangenen die onder den schijn van beleefdheid als gasten behandeld worden ned land heeft echter0.019231,  de hoop niet opgegeven om de vrijheid terug te krijgen zeker zal hij gebruik maken van de eerste gelegenheid de beste die het toeval hem aanbiedt zonder twijfel zal ik zijn voorbeeld volgen en toch zal ik niet zonder eenig leedwezen datgene met mij nemen wat de edelmoedigheid van den kapitein ons 0.019608, van de geheimen van den nautilus heeft laten doorgronden moet ik dien man haten bewonderen hij slachtoffer beul en dan zou ik om openhartig te spreken ik hem verliet gaarne die onderzeesche reis om de aarde volbrengen waarvan het begin zoo schoon geweest ik zou gaarne al de wonderen aanschouwen die0.020000,  de voor ons verborgen houden ik zou willen gezien hebben wat niemand nog heeft aanschouwd zelfs al moest ik met mijn leven dien onleschbaren dorst naar kennis betalen wat heb ik tot nog toe ontdekt niets bijna niets want wij hebben nog maar 24000 kilometer door den grooten oceaan afgelegd
0.035714, toen de nautilus op het punt den tocht onder zee te volgen ging ik naar den salon het luik werd gesloten en onze richting recht naar het westen
0.019231, gedurende verscheidene dagen zagen wij een groote menigte zeevogels een soort van meeuwen eenige er van werden zeer behendig gedood en leverden goed klaar gemaakt ons een voortreffelijk waterwild op onder de grootste vogels die zich ver van liet land wagen en als zij te moe zijn om te vliegen op he0.020000, t water uitrusten zag ik prachtige albatrossen die een leelijk geschreeuw doen hooren dat veel heeft van het balken van een ezel ook zag ik vlugge fregatvogels die snel de visschen uit het water ophaalden en een groot aantal schoone zeeduiven wier witte met rozenrood getinte vederen het gitzwart de0.142857, r vleugels des te beter deden uitkomen
0.019231, "neen ned neen" antwoordde ik op stelligen toon "laat ons meevaren de nautilus nadert het bewoonde land zij zal ook naar europa gaan laat hij ons daarheen brengen als wij eens onze zijn gekomen zullen wij zien wat de voorzichtigheid ons zal aanraden overigens geloof ik niet dat kapitein nemo ons za0.058824, l toestaan om op de kust van malabar coromandel te gaan jagen zooals de bosschen van nieuwguinea"
0.018182, tegen zeven uur 's avonds voer de nautilus halfweg onder water door een melkzee zoover het oog reikte scheen de oceaan melkwit dit ten gevolge van het schijnsel der maan neen want de maan die slechts twee dagen oud gaf nog niet veel schijn van zich en op dat oogenblik bovendien nog onder den gezich0.500000, teinder verborgen
0.033333, "ja" zei ik "het een treurig ambacht en dat slechts dient om aan modegrillen te voldoen maar zeg mij eens kapitein hoeveel parels kan een schuit per dag wel opvisschen"
0.125000, "niets mijnheer gij gaat toch mee niet waar"
0.071429, "mijnheer" zei koenraad "zal ons zeker wel eenige bijzonderheden van de parelvisscherij willen mededeelen"
0.083333, "deze" vroeg koenraad terwijl hij op het prachtig kleinood de glazenkast wees
0.071431, "wat waagt men daarbij" schertste ned land om eenige monden vol water te slikken"'
0.058824, "als mijnheer het waagt dan zie ik niet waarom zijn trouwe knecht het ook niet zou doen"
0.017544, "nog niet ik heb den nautilus niet te dicht bij de kust laten komen en wij zijn nog niet op de hoogte van de oesterbank van manaar ik heb de sloep laten gereed maken en deze zal ons op de juiste plek brengen en daardoor een vrij lange wandeling uitsparen onze duikertoestellen liggen de boot en wij 0.090909, trekken die eerst aan als onze onderzeesche tocht een aanvang neemt"
0.018182, tegen half vijf werden door de eerste lichtstralen aan den horizon de lijnen der kust beter zichtbaar het oosten die kust vlak naar het zuiden meer bergachtig wij waren er nog vijf kilometer af zoodat zij voor ons oog nog te veel met de nevels op zee ineensmolt de zee geheel verlaten geen enkele bo0.041667, ot geen enkele duiker deze vereenigingsplaats van de parelvisschers geheel eenzaam omdat wij zooals de kapitein mij reeds voorspeld een maand te vroeg kwamen

0.019231, ik wilde niet eens trachten te begrijpen waarom de kapitein besloot ons deze golf te brengen maar zonder voorbehoud keurde ik het goed dat de nautilus er binnen voer wij vorderden met geringe snelheid en dreven dan eens aan de oppervlakte dan weer onder water als wij eenig schip moesten vermijden z0.066667, oodat ik gelegenheid de oppervlakte en den bodem van deze merkwaardige zee beide te beschouwen
0.020833, de sponsachtige lichamen tellen omtrent driehonderd soorten zij worden zeer vele aangetroffen zelfs ook enkele stroomen en heeten dan riviersponsen maar het meest vindt men ze de middellandsche zee den griekschen archipel langs de syrische kust en de roode zee daar vindt men dan ook die fijne zacht0.021277, e sponsen die wel eens met anderhalf honderd frank betaald werden de geelachtige syrische de harde barbarijsche en andere maar daar ik geen hoop kon voeden om deze plantdieren de nabijheid van een der levantstedenvan welke ons de landengte van suez scheiddein oogenschouw te kunnen nemen vergenoegde0.100000,  ik mij er de roode zee kennis mee te maken
0.062500, "ja kapitein" antwoordde ik "en de nautilus heeft die studie wonderwel bevorderd het een verstandig schip"
0.058824, "zeker mijnheer verstandig stoutmoedig en onkwetsbaar het niet bevreesd voor de vreeselijke stormen stroomen klippen dezer zee"'
0.071431, "tot nog toe heb ik echter enkel helder water zonder eenige bijzondere kleur gezien"
0.028572, "omdat de plaats waar mozes met zijn volk doorgetrokken zoo verzand dat de kameelen er ter nauwernood tot aan de door het water gaan gij begrijpt dat mijn nautilus er dus geen vaarwater vinden kan"

0.019608, denzelfden avond dreef de nautilus op 30' nb aan de oppervlakte en naderde de arabische kust ik zag djeddah de belangrijke stapelplaats voor de egyptische syrische turksche en indische waren ik kon vrij duidelijk de gebouwen en de schepen langs de kaden en op de reede onderscheiden de zon die vrij 0.031250, laag stond scheen vlak op de huizen der stad en deed er de witheid des te meer van uitkomen buiten de stad duidden eenige houten en rieten hutten verblijf het der aan
0.018519, ik hoorde de tanden langs de ijzeren platen der sloep knarsen en de dugong verdween met den harpoen het lichaam maar weldra kwam het vaatje weer boven en weinige oogenblikken daarna verscheen het lichaam van het dier doch op den rug gekeerd de boot roeide er heen nam den dugong op sleeptouw en keer0.200000, de naar den nautilus terug
0.033334, de snelheid van den nautilus toen middelmatig hij vorderde maar langzaam ik merkte op dat het water der roode zee hoe langer hoe minder zout werd naarmate wij suez naderden
0.019231, om zes uur ging de nautilus dan eens op dan onder het water voorbij tor dat achter een baai ligt welker water rood gekleurd schijnt zooals de kapitein reeds gezegd toen viel de nacht te midden van een doffe stilte somtijds slechts afgebroken door het geschreeuw van den pelikaan van eenigen nachtvog0.041667, el door het geluid van de branding tegen de rotsen en het verwijderd gerucht van een stoomboot die de golven met raderen schroef doorkliefde
0.030303, ik volgde den kapitein het luik ging dicht de waterbakken werden gevuld en het vaartuig zonk ongeveer tien meter onder de golven toen ik naar mijn kamer wilde gaan hield nemo mij staande
0.062500, derhalve waren die schatten aan hun adres bezorgd waar en wie de zaakgelastigde van den kapitein
0.142857, "kunt u die dan naar willekeur regelen"
0.020408, ik kwam weer bij het raam de nautilus bewoog zich niet meer de hitte werd ondraaglijk de zee werd rood plaats van wit door de aanwezigheid van ijzerzouten niettegenstaande de salon zeer dicht gesloten drong een onverdraaglijke zwavellucht tot ons door en ik zag vuurroode vlammen die het electrisch 0.076923, licht verdoofden ik zweette ik stikte bijna ik dacht dat ik gebraden werd
0.020000, ik zag dus van het inwendige der middellandsche zee alleen wat een reiziger een sneltrein van het landschap ziet waardoor hij heen vliegt dat te zeggen den verren gezichteinder en niet wat onder zijn oogen langs hem gaat evenwel konden koenraad en ik eenige visschen bekijken wier snelheid ze eenige0.021277,  oogenblikken het vaarwater van den nautilus deed vertoeven wij bleven voor de glazen van den salon op den uitkijk staan doch ik kon maar weinige aanteekeningen maken de ichthyologie der middellandsche zee van de verschillende visschen die haar bewonen heb ik enkelen goed anderen slechts ter loops 0.019608, gezien zonder nog te spreken van hen die door de snelheid van den nautilus ons als voorbij vlogen ik zag het door onze electrische lantaarn helder verlicht gedeelte lampreien kronkelen van een meter lang die men bijna alle aantreft roggen van vijf voet breed met witten buik en gevlekten rug twaalf 0.032258, voet lange haaien door duikers deze zee zoo gevreesd wedijverden met hen snelheid zeevisschen bekend om den fijnen reuk goudvisschen prachtige steuren schoten langs ons glas en raakten het somwijlen aan
0.027027, "ja vriend" antwoordde ik "zij sluit dit gedeelte der zee bij de kust van libye geheel af en de peilingen van smith hebben bewezen dat de beide werelddeelen eertijds tusschen de kapen boco en farina verbonden waren"
0.047619, en koenraad ging geheel gerustgesteld voort dien hoog liggenden bodem der zee te bestudeeren waarover de nautilus met gematigde snelheid heenstreek
0.021739, hoeveel wrakken zag ik dan ook niet bij onzen snellen tocht door de diepte sommigen reeds geheel door koraalgewassen anderen slechts met wier en roest bedekt ankers kanonnen kogels schroeven stukken van stoommachines gebarsten ketels en soms houten wrakken die onder water ronddreven hetzij recht op0.019231,  hetzij onderste boven gekeerd van deze vergane schepen waren sommigen door aanzeiling anderen door het stooten op rots klip gezonken ik zag er die rechtop naar beneden waren gegaan met mast en tuig nog behoorlijke orde het als zij voor anker lagen en gereed waren om weg te zeilen toen de nautilus 0.018519, er tusschen doorvoer en ze met zijn electrisch licht bescheen het alsof zij hem met de vlag wilden begroeten en een nommervlag hijschen maar neen het niets dan de stilte des doods op dit ongeluksveld ik merkte op dat de bodem der zee meer met wrakken bedekt naarmate wij de straat van gibraltar nade0.021739, rden daar ontmoeten elkander de kusten van afrika en europa en dit nauw gedeelte komen ongelukken talrijker voor ik zag daar tal van ijzeren wrakken phantastische overblijfselen van stoombooten sommigen op zijde liggend anderen overeind als vreeselijk groote dieren van een van die stoombooten een z0.021739, ijde geheel opengespleten de schoorsteen krom gebogen van de raderen bleef niets dan wat ijzeren stangen het roer van het achterschip afgescheurd en hing er met slechts een keten nog bij terwijl de geheele achtersteven door zeezout ingevreten welk een vreeselijk schouwspel hoeveel fortuinen waren d0.019231, oor die schipbreuk niet te gronde gericht hoeveel slachtoffers mee naar de diepte gesleept er nog iemand van de schepelingen gered om die ontzettende ramp te kunnen navertellen bewaarden de golven het geheim van dit ongeluk ik weet niet waarom doch de gedachte schoot mij door het brein dat dit de a0.020408, tlas wel zijn kon die voor ongeveer twintig jaren met man en muis verdwenen en waarvan men nimmer meer heeft hooren spreken wat zou men een treurig tafereel kunnen ophangen van de diepten der zee van dat uitgestrekte kerkhof waar zoovele rijkdommen verloren zijn gegaan zooveel slachtoffers den dood0.500000,  hebben gevonden
0.090909, daar ik bleef zwijgen stond de amerikaan op en naderde mij
0.041667, op dit oogenblik ging de deur van den salon open en de kapitein verscheen hij zag mij en zei zonder inleiding op aangenamen toon
0.025000, "de spaansche scheepskapiteins verzetten zich tegen deze beslissing zij wilden een spaansche binnen vallen en als dit niet te cadix kon geschieden wilden zij naar de golf van vigo die op de noordwestkust van spanje ligt en niet geblokkeerd werd
0.166667, "ik weet het niet" antwoordde ned
0.034483, de amerikaan ging naar koenraad terug toen ik aangekleed trad ik den salon binnen het kompas stond niet zeer uitlokkend de richting zuidzuidwest wij verwijderden ons dus van europa
0.016949, toen ik een uur later op de kaart zag bemerkte ik dat de nautilus er op 17' nb en 22' wl stond aangeteekend dus op bijna zeshonderd kilometer van de naaste kust het nu onmogelijk aan de vlucht te denken en ik waag het dus niet de woede van den amerikaan te beschrijven toen ik hem de hoogte mededeel0.200000, de waar wij ons bevonden
0.020408, ach waarom ik niet meer tijd ik de steile helling van dezen berg wel willen afdalen om dit uitgestrekte land te doorloopen dat zonder twijfel afrika en amerika aan elkander verbond en om die groote voorwereldlijke steden te bezoeken daar strekten zich misschien onder mijn voet het krijgshaftige mak0.021277, himos het vrome eusebes uit wier reusachtige inwoners eeuwen lang leefden en die kracht genoeg bezaten om deze rotsblokken op elkander te stapelen nu nog weerstand biedend aan het geweld der wateren eens zal misschien een wonder de verdwenen bouwvallen weer boven het vlak der zee verheffen
0.020000, terwijl wij die verschillende soorten van dieren zaten te bekijken liet ik niet na de groote vlakte van atlantis te beschouwen soms noodzaakten grillige verhevenheden van den grond den nautilus om zijn snelheid te minderen en dan gleed hij met de behendigheid van een visch tusschen de dicht bij elk0.020833, ander liggende heuvels door indien hij door dit doolhof niet kon heenkomen verhief de nautilus zich als een luchtballon en wanneer hij dien hinderpaal heen hervatte hij zijn snelle vaart op eenige meters boven den bodem het een bewonderenswaardige en aangename vaart die aan een luchtreis deed denke0.076923, n met dit onderscheid evenwel dat de nautilus volkomen aan het roer gehoorzaamde
0.021739, "wij zijn midden een uitgedoofden vulkaan" antwoordde de kapitein "waar de zee binnengestroomd tengevolge van een scheur den grond daarin door een aardbeving ontstaan terwijl gij bed laagt mijnheer de professor de nautilus dit meer gekomen door een natuurlijken waterweg die op tien meter onder het 0.021739, oppervlak van den oceaan bestaat hier heeft mijn vaartuig een zekere gemakkelijke geheimzinnige tegen alle winden beveiligd waar zult gij ergens op eenige kust van uw vasteland van uw eilanden een reede vinden die tegen deze veilige ligplaats opwegen tegen de woede der orkanen beschermen kan"
0.025000, "hij behoort tot een van de talrijke eilandjes die deze zee als gezaaid zijn hij voor de schepen een klip maar voor ons een groote grot het toeval heeft mij die doen ontdekken en daarin heeft het mij goed gediend"
0.028571, "evenmin als ik er uit zou kunnen klimmen tot op een hoogte van honderd voet kan men den inwendigen wand bestijgen maar hooger op hangt de rots zoo veel dat zij niet bestegen kan worden"
0.017544, "juist die mijnen strekken zich evenals die van newcastle onder de golven uit hier gaan zij met scaphanders aan met spade en houweel de hand de steenkolen loshakken die ik zelfs niet uit de mijnen van het vaste land behoef te halen als ik nu aan het stoken ben om sodium te verkrijgen dan geeft de r0.066667, ook die uit den krater opstijgt dezen nog den schijn alsof de berg werking was"
0.018868, ik dankte den kapitein en ging mijn beide makkers opzoeken die hun hut nog niet hadden verlaten ik noodigde hen uit mij te volgen zonder te zeggen waar wij ons bevonden zij kwamen op het plat koenraad die zich niets verwonderde beschouwde het als iets zeer natuurlijks dat hij wakker werd onder een 0.045456, berg nadat hij onder water naar bed gegaan maar ned land dacht er slechts aan eens te onderzoeken deze grot geen uitgang
0.058824, "dit noem ik geen land" antwoordde de amerikaan "bovendien zijn wij er niet op maar er onder"
0.023256, tusschen den rotswand en het water een zandig strand dat op zijn grootste breedte vijfhonderd voet breed dit strand kon men gemakkelijk om het meer heen wandelen maar het benedeneinde der hooge rotswanden vormde een ongelijk terrein waarop schilderachtige opeenstapeling blokken vulkanische steenen 0.023810, en verbazende stukken puimsteen lagen al deze ruw door elkander geworpen steenblokken waren door het onderaardsche vuur met een laag glazuur bedekt die het electrisch licht schitterde het met steenglas vermengde oeverzand stoof onder onze treden als een wolk kleine sterren op
0.028572, "dat kan ik mij best voorstellen mijnheer" antwoordde koenraad "maar kan mijnheer mij ook zeggen waar deze groote hoogoven het werk gestaakt heeft en hij nu met het water van een kalm meer gevuld is"
0.020833, op een hoogte van ongeveer dertig meter veranderde de aard van den grond zonder dat deze daarom nog begaanbaarder werd wij stuitten op zwarte basaltblokken soms lagen zij met zwavel bedekt een vlakte neergeworpen dan weder vormden zij regelmatige prisma's die als kolommen overeind stonden om het gr0.022727, oote gewelf te ondersteunen en een prachtig schouwspel opleverden van de bouwkunst der natuur op andere plaatsen liepen tusschen deze basaltblokken lange stroomen van gestolten lava waarin strepen jodenlijm groote massa's zwavel zichtbaar waren het daglicht dat door den krater naar binnen viel verl0.062500, ichtte deze vulkanische overblijfselen die voor eeuwig dien uitgedoofden berg begraven lagen met een onzeker schijnsel
0.019608, de amerikaan wilde natuurlijk een voorraad honig medenemen en ik zoo onbarmhartig niet om er mij tegen te verzetten hij stak met behulp van zijn vuurslag wat droge bladeren met zwavel vermengd aan om de bijen te doen stikken weldra hield het gegons op en het nest leverde verscheidene ponden geurige0.125000, n honig ned land stak deze zijn voorraadzak
0.018519, "het volgende kapitein men weet dat als men naar de diepten van den oceaan afdaalt het plantenleven eerder ophoudt dan het dierlijk leven men weet dat waar men nog levende wezens vindt er geen enkele plant meer groeit men weet dat de oesters twee duizend meter diep onder water leven en dat mac clin0.019608, tock de held van de een levende zeester van een diepte van 2500 meter naar boven heeft gehaald men weet dat de equipage van de bulldog van de koninklijke engelsche marine een zeester op meer dan vier kilometer diepte gevischt heeft maar misschien zult gij zeggen kapitein dat men niets weet"
0.020833, ik nauwelijks den tijd om mijn verbazing dit nieuwe voorstel te toonen toen men op een wenk van den kapitein een photografisch toestel de zaal bracht door de wijd geopende ramen de door het electrisch licht beschenen watermassa uiterst helder en doorschijnend er geen schaduw geen afwijking trilling0.020833,  ons kunstlicht zichtbaar de zon zou voor zulk een proef niet gunstiger kunnen geweest zijn de nautilus werd door de schroef en de helling zijner uitstekende vlakken toom gehouden en lag onbeweeglijk stil het toestel werd op de onderzeesche rotsen gericht en weinige seconden hadden wij een buitenge0.023256, woon zuiver negatief beeld wij maakten later afdrukken waarvan ik hierbij de afbeelding gravure geef men ziet daarop die oorspronkelijke rotsen die het daglicht nooit heeft beschenen die benedenste granietklompen welke de krachtigste grondslagen der aarde vormen die diepe grotten de steenmassa uitg0.021739, ehold die onvergelijkelijk zuivere omtrekken zich zoo zwart afteekenend alsof een schilder uit de vlaamsche school ze gepenseeld heeft verder op een horizon van bergen een schoone golvende lijn die den achtergrond van een landschap uitmaakt ik kan geen beschrijving geven van die gladde zwarte glanz0.031250, ige rotsen zonder mosplanten zonder een enkele vlek vreemd van vorm en onwrikbaar vast staande op dien zandbodem schitterend onder de stralen van het electrisch licht toen de kapitein gedaan zei hij
0.100000, "inderdaad" antwoordde ik een tiental mannen moeten dunkt voldoende zijn"
0.022727, "hoor dan eens" hernam ik "elk mensch heeft ieder uur zooveel zuurstof noodig als er honderd liter zuivere lucht vervat dus vier en twintig uur de zuurstof van 2400 liter lucht nu moet men berekenen hoeveel de nautilus van deze hoeveelheid lucht bevatten kan"
0.100000, "en nog meer dan geduld" voegde koen er bij "onderwerping"
0.200000, "ik zeg wat waar is"
0.062500, "o" riep de amerikaan die de oogen niet van de zee afwendde "hij komt ons vaarwater"
0.027029, "ik geloof het graag ned zoo goed als ik geloof dat sommige walvisschen even groot zijn als honderd olifanten ga nu eens na welk een stoot het geven moet als zulk een massa zoo snel mogelijk vooruitschiet"
0.020833, "schepen geloof ik niet" antwoordde ik "men verhaalt echter dat 1820 deze zuidelijke poolzee een walvisch zich op de essex wierp en het schip met een snelheid van vier meter de seconde achteruit deed stuiven de golven drongen het achterschip binnen en deden de essex bijna oogenblikkelijk zinken"
0.166666, "leven die beesten lang" vroeg koenraad
0.055556, "mijnheer heeft gelijk" zei koenraad "muren zijn maar uitgevonden om geleerden te hinderen er moesten nergens muren zijn"
0.125000, "juist kapitein zeer juist" antwoordde ik vuur gerakend
0.083333, "ik reken er op" antwoordde ik op den toon der grootste overtuiging
0.500000, "zeker koen"
0.025000, den volgenden dag 22 maart maakte men zich te zes uur des morgens reeds tot het vertrek gereed de laatste schemering verdween het scherp koud de sterren flikkerden zeer helder boven ons schitterde het wonderschoone zuiderkruis de poolster der zuiderstreken
0.018519, om drie uur den morgen werd ik wakker door een hevigen schok ik ging mijn bed overeind zitten en luisterde toen ik plotseling midden de kamer werd geworpen de nautilus dus gestooten en hing blijkbaar geheel op zijde te midden van de grootste duisternis tastte ik langs den wand en kroop door de gang0.020833, en naar den salon die verlicht de meubels waren omver geworpen gelukkig stonden de glazen kasten met kostbaarheden overeind omdat zij op den vloer waren vastgeschroefd de schilderijen aan stuurboord hingen pal tegen den wand die aan bakboord waren er bijna een halven meter van verwijderd de nautilu0.111111, s helde dus naar stuurboordzijde en lag geheel onbeweeglijk
0.111111, "is onze weg naar het zuiden versperd" vroeg ik
0.021277, het werk werd onmiddellijk aangevangen en met onvermoeide werkzaamheid voortgezet plaats van om den nautilus te graven want dit zou een zeer moeielijk werk zijn geweest liet de kapitein een groote geul op acht meter afstands rondom den nautilus afbakenen daarna boorden zijn manschappen er op versch0.019231, illende punten te gelijk weldra viel men met het houweel op deze vaste massa aan waarvan men spoedig groote blokken loshakte volgens de wetten der zwaartekracht vlogen de blokken die minder wogen dan het water om zoo te zeggen naar het gewelf dat daardoor zooveel dikker als de bodem dunner werd doc0.083333, h dit kwam er niet op aan als de bodem maar slonk
0.027778, dien dag werkte ik verscheiden uren zoo hard ik kon dit werken gaf mij moed bovendien met werken kon ik den nautilus en die bedorven atmosfeer van ons vaartuig verlaten en dus wat zuivere lucht inademen
0.018868, den volgenden morgen 26 maart begon ik weer te werken wij waren aan den vijfden meter bezig de zij en bovenmuren van de ijsbank naderden ons van oogenblik tot oogenblik het duidelijk dat zij ons zouden insluiten voordat de nautilus los ik werd oogenblik wanhopend het houweel viel mij bijna uit de h0.021739, anden waarom behoefde ik nog te hakken als ik toch moest stikken het water dat tot ijs stolde het een straf die de grootste wreedaard niet zou hebben uitgedacht ik dacht dat ik tusschen de vreeselijke kaken van een monster zat die onweerstaanbaar tot elkander naderden
0.019609, en toch werkte niemand langer dan hij mocht als zijn taak volbracht gaf ieder aan zijn hijgenden opvolger het toestel dat hem nieuwe levenskracht deed toestroomen als het oogenblik daar gaf hij zijn toestel aan een ander en kwam hij weer even bedaard zonder morren de bedorven atmosfeer van het vaar0.333333, "wat" vroeg koenraad
0.020408, de ongelukkige koenraad te doen gehad met een krampvisch van de gevaarlijkste soort namelijk de cumana dit wonderlijk dier treft te midden van zulk een sterken geleider als het water de visschen op verscheiden meters afstand zoo groot toch de kracht van zijn electrisch vermogen waarvan de beide voo0.100000, rnaamste oppervlakken niet minder dan drie vierkante meter groot zijn
0.020409, gedurende eenige dagen verwijderde de nautilus zich hoe langer hoe meer van de amerikaansche kust waarschijnlijk wilde hij niet de golf van mexico de zee der antillen komen echter zou het hem daar met aan water ontbroken hebben want de gemiddelde diepte dezer 1804 meter doch waarschijnlijk beviel d0.071429, eze streek vol eilanden en waar het van stoombooten wemelde niet aan kapitein nemo
0.018182, ned land koenraad en ik hadden daarover een vrij lang gesprek sedert zes maanden zaten wij op den nautilus opgesloten wij hadden 68000 kilometer afgelegd en zooals ned land zei zag het er niet naar uit dat dit nog spoedig zou eindigen hij stelde mij dus iets voor waar ik het geheel niet verdacht op0.019231,  het den kapitein duidelijk deze vraag te stellen hij dacht ons voor onbepaalden tijd bij zich aan boord te houden zulk een poging stuitte mij tegen de borst volgens mijn meening zou het niets uitwerken wij behoefden niet te rekenen op den kapitein van den nautilus maar op ons zelven bovendien werd0.022222,  die man sinds eenigen tijd somberder meer teruggetrokken en minder gezellig hij scheen mij te mijden ik ontmoette hem maar zelden vroeger schepte hij er vermaak mij de onderzeesche wonderen te verklaren doch nu liet hij mij aan mijn en kwam niet meer den salon
0.250000, "wij hadden ongelijk koen"
0.200000, "geen visschers toch misschien geleerden"
0.500000, "ja ned"
0.500000, "ja koenraad"
0.066667, "en zag de bek er niet uit als die van een papegaai maar veel grooter"
0.100000, "het misschien hetzelfde als dat van de alecton" zei koenraad
0.333333, "dat niet gemakkelijk"
0.019231, een oogenblik meende ik dat de ongelukkige die door den inktvisch gegrepen zou worden bevrijd er waren reeds zeven van de acht armen afgehouwen een enkele nog zwaaide het slachtoffer als een veertje heen en weder en kronkelde de hoogte maar op het oogenblik dat kapitein nemo en zijn stuurman zich o0.026316, p het dier wilden werpen spoog het een straal zwartachtig vocht uit dat zich een zak die aan het onderlijf zit afscheidt wij werden er door verblind toen het voorbij de inktvisch verdwenen en daarmede mijn ongelukkige landgenoot
0.033333, kapitein nemo zag rood van het bloed hij stond onbeweeglijk bij de lantaarn beschouwde de zee die een van zijn makkers verzwolgen en dikke tranen rolden hem langs de wangen
0.166667, "neen laat mij begaan morgen "
0.055556, "maar ik en mijn makkers zijn gereed dit handschrift te bewaren en als gij ons de vrijheid hergeeft"
0.018519, de bodem der zee vormde daar een breede vallei van 120 kilometer waarin men den montblanc kunnen plaatsen zonder dat dan de top nog boven het vlak der zee uitgestoken het oosten wordt deze vallei afgesloten door een steilen muur van 2000 meter hoog wij kwamen er den 28sten mei en de nautilus bevond0.019231,  zich toen op niet meer dan 150 kilometer afstand van ierland zou kapitein nemo nog verder opwaarts varen om de nabijheid van groot te komen neen tot mijn verbazing wendde hij den steven zuidwaarts en voer weer naar de europeesche een oogenblik zag ik kaap clear en den vuurtoren der fastnetrots die0.090909,  als baken dient voor de duizenden schepen van glasgow en liverpool
0.020408, aan bakboordzijde bespeurde ik mets als het oneindig stille water aan stuurboord echter zag ik iets zeer groots de hoogte steken dat mijn aandacht trok men zou gezegd hebben dat het bouwvallen waren begraven onder een massa witte schelpen welke deze als een sneeuwkleed overdekten toen ik die massa 0.019608, nauwkeuriger bekeek meende ik de vormen van een schip te herkennen waarvan de masten gedeeltelijk gebroken waren en dat met den voorsteven het eerst moest gezonken zijn dit ongeluk zeker al zeer lang geleden plaats gehad dit wrak als het ware omkorst door de uit de zee afgescheiden kalk moest daar 0.018519, al heel wat jaren op den bodem van den oceaan gerust hebben welk schip dit waarom bezocht de nautilus dat graf het dan geen schipbreuk waardoor dit schip te gronde gegaan ik wist niet wat ik er van denken moest toen ik vlak naast mij den kapitein met langzame stem het volgende hoorde zeggen
0.250000, "de vengeur" riep ik
0.031250, ik keek de richting van het schip dat ik reeds opgemerkt het nabij den nautilus gekomen en ik kon zien dat het hard aanstoomde het nog maar zes kilometer van ons af
0.026316, "als ik het tuig en de kleine masten bezie" zei de amerikaan "dan zou ik wedden dat het een oorlogschip ik wou dat het naar ons toe kwam en dezen vervloekten nautilus als 't noodig den grond boorde"
0.071429, "zeg eens ned" vroeg ik "kun jij zien aan welke natie dit schip behoort"
0.062502, "mooi" riep ned terwijl hij het water van zich afschudde waarmee een nieuwe kogel hem bespat
0.071429, "maar zij kunnen toch zien dat zij met menschen te doen hebben" antwoordde ik
0.019231, het werd mijn geest plotseling helder zonder twijfel wist men nu waaraan men zich met het bestaan van het zoogenaamde monster houden moest zonder twijfel kapitein farragut van de abraham lincoln toen hij er zoo dicht bij en de amerikaan er met den harpoen naar wierp gezien dat de eenhoorn een onder0.038462, zeesch schip dat veel gevaarlijker kon zijn dan een bovennatuurlijk zeemonster ja zoo moest het zijn en overal vervolgde men nu zonder twijfel dit verschrikkelijk vernielingswerktuig
0.034483, ned land nam zijn zakdoek om er mee de lucht te zwaaien doch nauwelijks hij dien ontplooid een ijzeren hand wierp hem niettenstaande neds verbazende sterkte tegen den grond
0.066667, "zoo denk ik er ook over" antwoordde ned land bedaard "wij moeten den nacht afwachten"
0.025000, verstijfd van schrik stom van angst rezen mij de haren te berge ik de oogen wijd opengespalkt haalde ter nauwernood adem ik kon geen geluid geven en keek toe een onweerstaanbare aantrekkingskracht dwong mij voor het raam te blijven staan
