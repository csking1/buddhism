0.021277, ik deed het maal eer aan het bestond weder uit verschillende vischsoorten en zeeplanten wij dronken daarbij zuiver water waarin ik op des kapiteins voorbeeld eenige droppels van een gistenden drank voegde welke op de kamtschatdaalsche wijze uit een soort van zeewier (rhodomenia palmaea) bereid de k0.090909, apitein zonder een woord te spreken toen hij gedaan zeide hij

0.019608, deze ontmoeting deed mij er op bedacht zijn dat andere vrij wat verschrikkelijker dieren deze diepte bewoonden en dat mijn scaphander mij niet altijd tegen hen zou beveiligen ik er tot op dit oogenblik niet gedacht maar besloot op mijne hoede te zijn overigens veronderstelde ik dat deze rust het ei0.043478, nde onzer wandeling aanwees maar ik bedroog mij en plaats van naar de nautilus terug te keeren vervolgde de kapitein zijn stoutmoedigen tocht

0.041667, "zoo goed als niets het niets anders dan de zilveren schubben der blei water bewaard en ammoniak opgelost het heeft niet de minste waarde"
0.028571, "ja en ik geloof niet dat ik mij bedrieg als ik die parel op een millioen gulden schat en zonder twijfel heeft de kapitein er alleen de moeite voor gedaan om ze op te rapen"
0.500000, "waarom niet"
0.028572, "ned land heeft gelijk" zei ik "en zoo wij europa amerika ooit een parel van een twee millioen medebrengen dan zal dit ten minste groot gewicht en meer waarschijnlijkheid aan het verhaal onzer lotgevallen geven"
0.200000, een parel van vijf millioen
0.100000, "zijt gij klaar om te vertrekken mijnheer aronnax" vroeg hij
0.333333, "en mijn makkers"
0.023256, ik antwoordde niet en die verdachte golven bekijkende begon ik met behulp van de matrozen mijn zwaar pak aan te trekken de kapitein en mijn beide makkers kleedden zich ook geen van de mannen van den nautilus zou ons op dien tocht vergezellen
0.022222, "die toestellen zouden nutteloos zijn" antwoordde de kapitein "wij dalen op geen groote diepte af en de zonnestralen zullen onzen tocht genoeg verlichten bovendien zou het niet voorzichtig zijn onze electrische lantaarns mee te nemen het licht kon onverwacht eens eenig gevaarlijk bewoner dier strek0.500000, en aantrekken"
0.019608, tegen zeven uur kwamen wij op de oesterbank waarop millioenen parelschelpen te vinden waren deze kostbare weekdieren zaten aan den rotsgrond vast met een bruin weefsel dat hun belette zich van de plaats te bewegen dit opzicht zijn deze dieren minder zelfs dan de mossels wien de natuur niet alle bew0.333333, eegkracht ontnomen heeft
0.024390, ned land richtte ondertusschen den kapitein op die gelukkig zonder eenige wond opstond recht naar den hindoe ging het touw doorsneed waarmede deze aan den steen gebonden hem zijn armen nam en hem met een krachtigcn stoot naar de oppervlakte duwde
0.020408, gelukkig zag ik den drenkeling door het krachtig wrijven van den kapitein en koenraad langzamerhand het bewustzijn herkrijgen hij opende de oogen weder hoe groot moeten zijn verbazing en zijn schrik niet geweest zijn toen hij vier groote koperen hoofden zich heen gebukt zag en bovenal wat moest hij0.021739,  wel denken toen kapitein nemo een zakje met parels te voorschijn halend hem dit de hand drukte deze schitterende aalmoes van den waterman werd door den armen singalees bevend aangenomen zijn verwilderde oogen duidden bovendien genoegzaam aan dat hij niet wist aan welke bovenmenschelijke wezens hij0.142857,  het leven en fortuin tegelijk te danken
0.062501, de sloep vloog de baren eenige minuten later ontmoetten wij het lichaam van den dooden haai
0.018182, aan de zwarte kleur van het uiteinden der vinnen herkende ik er een van de vreeselijkste soort uit den indischen archipel het dier ruim 8 meter lang de bek besloeg een derde deel van het lichaam het beest nog jong zooals men aan de zes rijen tanden zien kon die den vorm van gelijkbeenige driehoeken0.021277,  de bovenkaak zaten koenraad bekeek het beest met een wetenschappelijke belangstelling en ik ben er zeker van dat hij het reeds bij een bijzondere klasse indeelde terwijl ik dat levenlooze lichaam beschouwde verscheen er plotseling een dozijn van die vraatzuchtige dieren om onze sloep maar zonder z0.055556, ich om ons te bekommeren wierpen zij zich op het kreng en betwistten er elkander de brokken van
0.020000, "ja en neen mijnheer aronnax" zei de kapitein die de roode zee nauwkeurig scheen te kennen "wat nu niet meer gevaarlijk voor nieuwere goed gebouwde schepen die zich door stoomkracht naar willekeur kunnen bewegen het wel voor alle soort van vaartuigen der ouden stel u die zeevaarders der oudheid voo0.020833, r hun schuiten wier planken met palmvezels aan elkander genaaid met gesmolten hars gebreeuwd en met zeehondenvet besmeerd waren zij hadden geen instrumenten om hun richting waar te nemen en zij voeren maar op de gis te midden van hun geheel onbekende stroomen onder zulke omstandigheden moesten schi0.020408, pbreuken dikwijls voorkomen maar onzen tijd hebben de stoombooten die tusschen suez en dienst doen niets meer van de stormen deze zee te vreezen gezagvoerders en reizigers brengen voor hun vertrek geen zoenoffers meer en als zij terugkomen gaan zij niet meer met kransen en linten getooid den goden 0.100000, den eersten den besten tempel danken voor hun behouden aankomst"
0.027778, "omdat gij straks gesproken hebt van den doortocht der en de vernietiging van het egyptische leger wilde ik van u wel eens weten gij onder water de sporen van dit groot geschiedkundig feit ook herkend heb"
0.058824, "ja kapitein hoewel ik mij eigenlijk niets meer verwonderen moest sedert ik bij u aan boord ben"
0.071429, "tot op zekere diepte maar op vijftig meter vindt men reeds een onwrikbaren rotsgrond"
0.071429, "ben ik ook onbescheiden als ik u vraag hoe gij dien tunnel ontdekt hebt"
0.333333, de arabische tunnel
0.071429, "neen ned" antwoordde ik "maar gij weet wel dat ik uw oogen niet heb"
0.200000, "zeker zou ik dat graag"
0.016949, "ja soms" antwoordde de kapitein "dit dier laat zijn aanvallers niet los het werpt hun boot om maar met ned land dat gevaar niet te vreezen zijn oog juist zijn arm zeker indien ik hem aanbeveel om dien dugong niet te missen doe ik dat omdat het een fijn stuk wild en ik weet wel dat ned niet afkeeri0.200000, g van een lekker hapje"
0.033333, "als dit dier dan eens bij toeval het laatste van zijn soort was" vroeg koenraad ernstig "zou het dan geen zaak zijn om het het belang der wetenschap te sparen"
0.019608, men moest zware en sterke takels gebruiken om het dier op het plat te hijschen het woog 5000 kilogram men sneed het tegenwoordigheid van den harpoenier stukken omdat deze er op gesteld al de bijzonderheden van die bewerking te volgen denzelfden dag diende de hofmeester mij aan het diner eenige plak0.038462, ken van het vleesch van den dugong voor dat door den kok zeer lekker gereed gemaakt ik vond het uitmuntend en beter dan kalfs zelfs rundvleesch
0.040000, ik moest onwillekeurig glimlachen toen ik koenraad zijn persoon zoo geheel hoorde wegcijferen de amerikaan echter moest blijde zijn hem niet tegen zich te hebben
0.019231, "vriend ned" zei ik "ziehier mijn antwoord je hebt gelijk en mijn bewijzen houden tegenover de uwe geen steek gij moet op den goeden wil van kapitein nemo niet rekenen de voorzichtigheid verbiedt hem ons de vrijheid terug te geven derhalve gebiedt deze deugd ons om van de eerste de beste gelegenhei0.111111, d om den nautilus te verlaten gebruik te maken"
0.100001, "en zou je dan met zwemmen je trachten te redden"
0.050000, mijn oogen konden zich van al die wonderen der zee niet afwenden toen ik door een onverwachte verschijning werd getroffen
0.083334, ik ging voort met mijn werk doch de hitte werd bijna onverdraaglijk
0.023810, "niets ooit deze vulkanische streken afgeloopen" antwoordde nemo "en de aarde wordt hier altijd door onderaardsch vuur beweging gebracht het negentiende jaar onzer jaartelling verscheen volgens cassiodorus en plinius een nieuw eiland theia het goddelijke genaamd op dezelfde plaats waar zich korteli0.018868, ngs nieuwe eilandjes hebben gevormd later verdween het onder de golven om het jaar 69 nog eens te verschijnen en nog eenmaal te verdwijnen sedert dien tijd tot op onze dagen bespeurde men geen vulkanische werking totdat op 3 februari 1866 een nieuw eilandje waaraan men den naam van george gaf de na0.020833, bijheid van neakameni te midden van zwaveldampen opsteeg en zich drie dagen later daaraan vasthechtte zeven dagen later 13 februari verscheen het eilandje aphroessa door een kanaal van tien meter breed van neakameni gescheiden ik juist deze zee toen het verschijnsel zich voordeed en ik heb het alle0.022222,  bijzonderheden kunnen nagaan het eilandje aphroessa rond drie honderd meter doorsnede en tien meter hoog het bestond uit zwarte glasachtige lava met stukken veldspaat vermengd eindelijk vertoonde zich den 10den maart een veel kleiner eiland reka genaamd bij neakameni en sedert dien tijd hebben zic0.090909, h deze drie eilandjes vereenigd en vormen op dit oogenblik geheel"
0.020408, gedurende den nacht van den 16den op den 17den februari waren wij de westelijke helft der middellandsche zee gekomen waarvan de grootste diepte ongeveer 3000 meter bedraagt de nautilus daalde daar tot de onderste lagen der zee plaats van de wonderen der natuur aanschouwde mijn oog daar allerhande h0.023256, artroerende en vreeselijke tooneelen wij waren toch dat gedeelte der middellandsche zee dat steeds zoo vruchtbaar geweest aan allerlei rampen hoeveel schepen hebben er tusschen de kusten van en provence geen schipbreuk geleden hoeveel vaartuigen zijn er niet verdwenen de middellandsche zee vergelij0.019231, king van de uitgestrektheid van den grooten oceaan slechts een meer maar een meer welks water grillig en veranderlijk den hoogsten graad heden het kalm en kabbelt het zachtkens tegen de ranke kiel eener kleine boot dan weer woedt het en bruist het op door de stormwinden gegeeseld zoodat zelfs de st0.111111, erkste schepen door de korte golven worden stuk geslagen
0.026316, de nautilus doorkliefde het water van den oceaan met zijn schroef drie en een halve maand na een afstand te hebben afgelegd van bijna 40000 kilometer waar gingen wij nu heen en wat zou ons de toekomst opleveren
0.017544, daarop ging hij heen en liet mij versuft zitten ik mij verbeeld dat als het geval eens daar ik den tijd zou hebben om te overdenken en de zaak te bepraten mijn koppige makker liet mij daarvoor geen tijd en wat zou ik hem ook gezegd hebben ned land honderdmaal gelijk het nu een vrij goede gelegenhei0.021739, d en hij maakte er gebruik van kon ik mijn woord intrekken en de verantwoordelijkheid op mij laden van uit geheel persoonlijke belangen de toekomst mijner makkers de waagschaal te stellen kon morgen de kapitein ons niet volle zee ver van alle land met zich voeren
0.018182, plotseling voelde ik een lichten schok ik begreep dat de nautilus stil lag op den bodem van den oceaan mijn onrust verdubbelde het afgesproken teeken werd door den amerikaan niet gegeven de lust bekroop mij om naar hem toe te gaan hem te verzoeken zijn plan uit te stellen ik voelde dat onze vaart n0.125000, iet meer onder de gewone omstandigheden plaats vond
0.038462, "dit konvooi moest zich naar cadix begeven maar toen de admiraal vernam dat de engelsche vloot die buurt kruiste besloot hij een fransche binnen te loopen
0.055556, kapitein nemo zweeg ik moet bekennen dat ik nog niet begreep waarom de geschiedenis mij belangstelling moest inboezemen
0.020000, middernacht naderde het water zeer donker doch de kapitein wees mij de verte een roodachtig punt een soort van breede schemering op ongeveer twee kilometer van den nautilus zichtbaar ik niet kunnen zeggen wat dit voor vuur waardoor het gevoed werd en hoe en waarom het de watermassa kon opflikkeren 0.020000, alle gevalle gaf het ons licht wel zwak doch ik gewendde mij weldra aan die bijzondere schemering en ik begreep deze omstandigheid de nutteloosheid der toestellen van ruhmkorff de kapitein en ik liepen dicht naast elkander recht op het aangewezen vuur af de bodem rees langzaam wij maakten met behul0.033335, p onzer stokken groote stappen doch wij vorderden toch niet hard want onze voeten zakten dikwijls de modder die met zeewier vermengd en hier en daar met platte steenen bezaaid
0.020408, de geschiedschrijver die de groote daden van dit heldentijdvak te boek heeft gesteld plato zijn gesprek tusschen tinaeus en kritias om zoo te zeggen onder den invloed van den dichter en wetgever solon geschreven deze onderhield zich eens met eenige wijze grijsaards uit een stad toen reeds acht eeuw0.020833, en oud zooals de opschriften op de tempelmuren getuigen een dier wijzen verhaalde de geschiedenis eener stad nog duizend jaar ouder deze oude stad toen zij negen eeuwen bestaan door de atlanten overvallen en gedeeltelijk verwoest dit volk zei hij woonde een uitgestrekt land veel grooter dan afrika 0.021739, en bij elkander en een oppervlakte beslaande van tot nb hun gebied strekte zich tot aan egypte uit zij wilden ook griekenland de wet voorschrijven doch daar stieten zij het hoofd tegen den onweerstaanbaren moed der hellenen eeuwen verliepen een geweldige overstrooming met aardbevingen gepaard plaat0.034483, s dag en nacht waren voldoende om dit atlantis te vernietigen waarvan madeira de azorische canarische en kaapverdische eilanden nu nog als hoogste punten zich uit de zee verheffen
0.022728, "vermoedelijk koenraad omdat eenige aardbeving onder het oppervlak van den oceaan de opening heeft gemaakt waardoor de nautilus hier binnen gekomen toen het water der zee waarschijnlijk naar binnen gestort er een vreeselijke strijd tusschen de beide elementen gevoerd die ten voordeele van neptunus 0.066667, er zijn evenwel reeds eeuwen overheen gegaan en de overstroomde vulkaan een vreedzame grot geworden"
0.166667, "op op" riep de brave jongen
0.020833, "welk een toestand" riep ik uit "deze laagten te bezoeken waar de mensch nog nooit doorgedrongen" zie eens kapitein zie die prachtige rotsen die onbewoonde grotten die verborgen schuilhoeken der aarde waar het leven onmogelijk hoe jammer dat wij van deze onbekende oorden niets anders mee kunnen nem0.250000, en dan de herinnering"
0.125000, "welnu" zei ned "waarom zouden er meer zijn"
0.021740, "omdat" zei ik "als mijn voorgevoel mij niet bedriegt en ik het leven van kapitein nemo goed begrepen heb de nautilus niet alleen een vaartuig maar ook een schuilplaats zijn moet voor allen die even als de kapitein elke betrekking met het bewoonde land hebben afgebroken"
0.125000, ik berekende het snel op een stukje papier
0.020000, daarna hervatte hij het gesprek aldus "gij noemt den potvisch een klein dier men verhaalt toch van reusachtige potvisschen het zijn slimme beesten sommige zegt men bedekken zich met zeeplanten en wier men denkt dan dat het eilanden zijn men landt er op men vestigt er zich legt vuur aan"
0.027778, "precies als de reisavonturen van simbad den zeevaarder" hernam ik lachend "kom ned het schijnt dat je van wonderverhalen houdt wat moeten dat wel voor potvisschen zijn ik hoop toch dat je die verhalen niet gelooft"
0.250000, "ik ontken het niet"
0.021739, deze homerische slachting waaraan de potvisschen niet konden ontkomen duurde ongeveer een uur meermalen beproefden een tien twaalftal met vereende krachten den nautilus onder hun gewicht te verpletteren wij konden door het glas hun vreeselijken muil hunne groote tanden hun woest oog zien ned land z0.019608, ich zelven niet meer meester dreigde ze en schold ze uit men voelde dat zij zich aan ons vaartuig vastklampten evenals honden die een stuk wild het kreupelhout vastpakken maar de nautilus bracht de schroef slechts wat sneller beweging sleepte hen mee voerde ze naar het oppervlak der zee zonder zich0.025641,  om hun verbazend gewicht om hun krachtige aanvallen te bekreunen eindelijk de menigte potvisschen wat opgedund en werd de zee wederom kalm ik voelde dat wij weer boven kwamen het luik werd geopend en wij snelden naar het plat
0.071429, "het een verdelging van schadelijke dieren" antwoordde de kapitein "en de nautilus geen slachtersmes"
0.021277, zoo gleed de nautilus door een bekwame hand bestuurd tusschen al die ijsbergen die eindelooze ijsvelden die drijvende ijsschotsen die langere kortere ijsbrokken door de temperatuur vrij laag de thermometer wees de lucht twee drie graden onder nul doch wij waren warm gekleed met bont waarvoor zeekal0.021277, ven en ijsberen de huiden hadden geleverd het inwendige van den nautilus werd door de electrische toestellen regelmatig verwarmd en tartte dus de vinnigste koude bovendien zou het voldoende geweest zijn eenige meters onder water te duiken om er een dragelijke temperatuur te vinden twee maanden eerd0.030303, er zouden wij op deze hoogte aanhoudend dag hebben gehad maar nu werd het gedurende drie vier uur reeds nacht en later zouden deze poolstreken gedurende zes maanden een nachtelijk duister gehuld zijn
0.019608, dikwijls zag ik geen enkelen uitgang en dacht dat wij bepaald waren ingesloten maar kapitein nemo werd door een soort van instinct geleid en ontdekte bij de minste sporen zelf steeds nieuwe openingen waar hij met zijn nautilus doorheen kon komen hij bedroog zich nimmer op het gezicht van het minste0.045455,  spoor van het blauwgekleurde zeewater tusschen de ijsvlakten ik twijfelde er dus niet aan hij zijn nautilus reeds meer deze zuidelijke gebracht
0.047620, "de eenige moeilijkheid" hernam kapitein nemo "zal zijn om verscheiden dagen onder water te blijven zonder onze lucht te kunnen ververschen"
0.142857, "maar wij gaan naar de pool ned"
0.050000, "aan u de eer mijnheer" zei ik tot den kapitein "om het eerst den voet op dezen grond te zetten"
0.021277, ik keek onwillekeurig naar het raam maar kon mijn oogen niet naar die zijde gericht houden ik begreep wat het de nautilus zich met groote snelheid beweging gezet alle schitterende kristallen der ijsmuren waren daardoor voor het oog vurige strepen geworden de schittering dezer millioenen diamanten s0.018519, molt tot vuur te zamen de nautilus voer daardoor als het ware een zee van vuur de wanden van den salon werden daarop dichtgeschoven wij hielden de handen voor de oogen omdat ons netvlies aangedaan alsof wij het al te felle zonlicht hadden zitten staren er eenige tijd noodig voordat onze oogen aan d0.076923, e duisternis gewend waren eindelijk namen wij de handen voor de oogen weg
0.071429, op dat oogenblik kwam de kapitein den salon en ik trad op hem toe
0.111111, "hij zal je hulp niet weigeren kom maar mee"
0.166667, "ja" antwoordde ik "maar wat dan"
0.035714, "zonder twijfel" meende ned land "maar wij moeten nu nog weten wij naar den grooten den atlantischen oceaan gaan dat te zeggen naar een druk weinig bevaren zee"
0.050000, "zou de kapitein nu ook de noordpool willen opzoeken en dan door de beruchte noordelijke doorvaart den grooten oceaan komen"
0.047619, "was hij geen zes meter ongeveer lang" vroeg koenraad die aan een raam naar de kloven de rotsen stond te kijken
0.047619, ik vervolgde mijn werk de monsters bleven met zulk een juistheid van beweging ons vaarwater dat zij onbeweeglijk schenen te zijn
0.019608, "de oorzaak is" zei ik "dat de temperatuur van het water van den golfstroom als hij de golf van mexico verlaat bijna niet verschilt van die van ons bloed deze golfstroom een groote warmteaanbrenger waardoor sommige kusten van europa met een eeuwigdurend groen zijn bedekt en als wij maury mogen gelo0.033333, oven zou deze stroom zoo men hem geheel kon benutten hitte genoeg opleveren om een stroom ijzer zoo groot als de amazonenrivier de missouri voortdurenden staat van gloeihitte te houden"
0.017241, ik bleef alleen toen de zaak beslist besloot ik er dadelijk een einde aan te maken ik heb liever dat iets achter den rug dan dat het nog geschieden moet ik kwam weer mijn kamer ik hoorde die van den kapitein loopen ik mocht dus de gelegenheid van hem te spreken te krijgen niet laten ontglippen ik k0.017857, lopte aan de deur maar kreeg geen antwoord ik klopte nog eens en draaide toen de kruk om de deur ging open ik trad binnen de kapitein zat voorovergebogen aan de tafel en mij niet gehoord besloten niet heen te gaan voor ik hem ondervraagd naderde ik hij hief plotseling het hoofd op fronste de wenkbr0.166667, auwen en zei op ruwen roon
0.019231, op den 18den mei barstte de storm los juist toen de nautilus op de hoogte van longisland op eenige kilometers van newyork ik kan dien strijd der elementen beschrijven want plaats van naar de diepte te gaan wilde kapitein nemo door een onverklaarbare gril den storm aan de oppervlakte trotseeren de w0.027778, ind woei uit het zuidwesten eerst het een flinke bries die met een snelheid van 15 meter de seconde woei deze vermeerderde tegen drie uren des namiddags tot 25 meter het de snelheid van den storm
0.020834, het kolossale schip zonk langzaam de nautilus volgde het en bespiedde al zijn bewegingen plotseling er een ontploffing plaats de samengeperste lucht deed het dek openbarsten alsof de kruitkamer vuur gevat het water werd teruggeslagen dat de nautilus er door op zijde werd geduwd toen zonk het ongelu0.023256, kkige schip sneller de masten daalden vol slachtoffers onder water daarna de ra's die bogen onder de menigte schepelingen en eindelijk de top van den grooten mast toen verdween de sombere massa en daarmee al de lijken die een ontzettend zog werden meegesleept
0.019608, ondertusschen zou het tien uur slaan het oogenblik gekomen waarop ik mijn kamer verlaten en mij bij mijn makkers moest voegen ik mocht niet meer aarzelen al stond de kapitein ook mij ik opende voorzichtig de deur en toch dacht ik toen zij opendraaide dat de scharnieren een vreeselijk geweld maakten0.166667,  misschien bestond dat geraas slechts verbeelding
0.020000, maar wat er van den nautilus geworden heeft hij aan den maalstroom kunnen weerstand bieden leeft kapitein nemo nog vervolgt hij onder de zee zijn vreeselijke wraakoefening hij met het laatste zoenoffer zal de zee eens het handschrift op het strand werpen dat de geschiedenis van zijn leven bevat zal0.038462,  ik eindelijk den naam van dien man te weten komen zal het gezonken schip ons door zijn herkomst ook zeggen tot welke natie kapitein nemo behoort
