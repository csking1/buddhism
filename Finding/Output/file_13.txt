0.022223, toen ik te newyork kwam de belangstelling haar hoogste standpunt bereikt het denkbeeld van een drijvend eiland van eene onbereikbare klip men geheel en al laten varen want als die klip geene machine bevatte hoe zij zich dan met zulk eene verbazende snelheid kunnen verplaatsen
0.020408, de veronderstelling van een oorlogswerktuig viel geheel en al 't water na de verklaring der onderscheiden mogendheden omdat het hier eene zaak van algemeen belang gold en de groote vaart den oceaan er door leed mocht men de oprechtheid der gouvernementen niet twijfel trekken hoe kon men overigens o0.022222, ok aannemen dat zulk een schip gebouwd zonder door iemand gezien te zijn om zulke omstandigheden een geheim te bewaren reeds moeielijk voor een bijzonder persoon maar zeker onmogelijk voor eene regeering wier handelingen voortdurend door afgunstige mogendheden worden gadegeslagen toen er dus een on0.021739, derzoek ingesteld engeland frankrijk rusland pruisen spanje amerika ja zelfs turkije werd de veronderstelling van een onderzeeschen monitor voor goed verworpen nu kwam het monster weder op de baan ten spijt van de aardigheden waarmede het door kleine bladen overstelpt werd het licht te begrijpen da0.045455, t nu men zich eenmaal tot een levend wezen bepalen moest de verbeelding weldra de meest dwaze veronderstellingen maakte op ichthyologisch gebied
0.250000, mijnheer 3 juli 1867
0.017241, ik zeker van den trouwen jongen gewoonlijk vroeg ik hem nooit hij mij op mijne reizen verkoos te volgen niet maar ditmaal gold het een tocht die tot 't oneindige kon duren en dan nog wel een zeer gevaarlijken tocht om een dier te vervolgen dat staat om een fregat als een notedop te doen zinken er w0.047619, el reden om er eens na te denken zelfs voor den kalmsten mensch van de wereld wat zou koenraad wel zeggen
0.090909, "wij zullen hier op ons gemak zijn" zeide ik tegen koenraad
0.111111, "zeker en eenige cijfers kunnen u dit gemakkelijk bewijzen"
0.022222, "welnu mijn waarde harpoenier als gewervelde dieren van eenige honderden meter lang en dik naar evenredigheid zich zulke diepten ophielden zouden zij omdat de oppervlakte van hun lichaam zooveel grooter een gewicht van millioenen maal millioenen kilogrammen te dragen hebben en bereken dan maar eens0.055556,  welk een weerstandsvermogen hun skelet en welke kracht hun samenstel hebben moet om zulk eene drukking te weerstaan"
0.033333, "gij hebt mij van eene zaak overtuigd mijnheer de natuurkenner en dat dat als zulke dieren de diepten der zee bestaan zij noodzakelijk zoo sterk moeten zijn als gij zegt"
0.023810, "neen mijnheer" antwoordde ik met overtuiging "nooit hebben steenboorders salpen zulk eene lichtgevende kracht deze glans moet volstrekt van electrieken aard zijn bovendien zie maar eens het verandert van plaats het beweegt zich naar voren naar achteren het snelt naar ons toe"
0.090909, "dan zet ik het leven van mijne matrozen op het spel"
0.019608, de abraham lincoln door zijne sterke schroef vooruitgestuwd stoomde recht op het dier aan dit liet zich tot op eene halve kabellengte naderen toen nam het den schijn aan van niet eens te willen duiken maar zoowat te vluchten en stelde zich tevreden met den afstand te bewaren deze vervolging duurde 0.029412, ongeveer drie kwartier zonder dat het fregat twee vadem op het dier het dus duidelijk dat door zoo voort te gaan men het nooit bereiken zou de kapitein trok zich woedend aan den baard
0.017545, ned land ging op zijn post zitten het vuur werd ferm aangestookt de schroef draaide 43 maal de minuut en de stoom perste door de kleppen toen men de log uitwierp kon men zien dat de abraham lincoln met eene vaart van 185 kilometer 't uur liep maar het verwenschte dier liep even snel gedurende een u0.022222, ur ongeveer bleef het fregat dezelfde snelheid behouden zonder vadem te winnen het vernederend voor een van de snelste schepen der amerikaansche vloot doffe woede bezielde de equipage de matrozen scholden op het monster dat overigens zich niet verwaardigde eenig antwoord te geven kapitein farragut 0.058824, trok niet alleen aan zijn baard maar hij kauwde er op hij riep den machinist nog eens
0.076923, welnu ik moet bekennen dat het mij niet onaangenaam deze kans te loopen
0.050000, "een ander die beter bij de hand is" schreeuwde de kapitein "500 dollars voor hem die het verwenschte beest raakt"
0.333333, een vreemdsoortige walvisch
0.047619, "misschien" antwoordde koenraad bedaard "maar wij hebben toch nog eenige uren voor ons en eenige uren kan er heel wat gebeuren"
0.500000, "een eiland"
0.058824, "en nu begreep ik aanstonds waarom mijn harpoen hem niet heeft getroffen en op zijn huid afgesprongen"
0.022222, "duizend duivels" riep hij "dat zijn lui aan wie de nog een lesje de gastvrijheid zouden kunnen geven het ontbreekt er nog maar aan dat het menscheneters zijn het zou mij niet verwonderen maar ik verklaar dat ik mij niet zonder tegenstand zal laten opeten"
0.020408, de plotselinge verlichting der hut liet mij die de kleinste bijzonderheden zien er waren slechts een tafel en vijf bankjes te vinden de onzichtbare deur moest hermetisch gesloten zijn geen het minste geluid trof ons oor alles scheen dood het vaartuig ging het voorwaarts dreef het aan de oppervlakte0.083333,  van den oceaan het de diepte gedaald ik kon het niet gissen
0.033333, echter dat licht niet voor niets ontstoken ik hoopte dus dat eenigen van de equipage zich weldra zouden vertoonen als men de menschen wil vergeten verlicht men hunne gevangenis niet
0.033333, "nu het uwe beurt" zeide ik tot den harpoenier "praat gij nu eens het beste engelsch dat ooit een angelsaks gesproken heeft en beproef eens gij gelukkiger zijt dan ik"
0.055556, "'t zou wat" antwoordde de haatdragende harpoenier "wat drommel zouden wij hier te eten krijgen schildpaddenlever haaiengebraad zeehondenbiefstuk"
0.047619, "zoo" zeide hij "dat verklaart volkomen het gebrul dat wij hoorden toen de abraham lincoln den zoogenaamden eenhoorn het gezicht kreeg"
0.019231, om maar te klagen en dat reeds iets als die zeeroovers (ik noem ze zeeroovers om mijnheer niet te ergeren die verbiedt om ze menscheneters te noemen) als die zeeroovers zich verbeelden dat zij mij die stinkende kooi zullen houden zonder nog eerst te hooren met welke verwenschingen ik aan mijne woed0.041667, e lucht geef dan zullen zij zich bedriegen spreek eens vrij uit mijnheer zoudt gij denken dat zij ons lang die ijzeren kooi houden"
0.020408, daarop zwegen wij stil en elk onzer gaf zich aan zijne overpeinzingen ik beken dat ik niettegenstaande de verzekering van den harpoenier mij geene maakte ik geloofde niet aan die gunstige kans waarvan ned land gesproken om zoo goed bestuurd te worden het vaartuig zeker eene talrijke equipage noodig0.017857,  en daarom zouden wij bij eene worsteling met eene veel te groote overmacht te doen hebben overigens moesten wij voor alles vrij zijn en dat waren wij niet ik zag zelfs geen enkel middel om uit de goed gesloten ijzeren hut te geraken en als de vreemde kapitein van dat schip een geheim te bewaren wa0.019232, t mij ten minste waarschijnlijk toescheen dan zou hij ons niet vrij aan boord laten rondloopen zou hij zich nu met geweld van ons ontslaan zou hij ons te eeniger tijd het een ander land afzetten dit bleef de vraag al die veronderstellingen schenen mij even waarschijnlijk en men moest een harpoenier0.125000,  zijn om ooit op eene bevrijding te hopen
0.030303, "wel de vrijheid van te gaan te komen te zien en alles na te gaan wat hier gebeurt uitgezonderd eenige zeer enkele gevallen kortom de vrijheid welke mijne makkers en ik zelf genieten"
0.041667, "welnu komaan" riep ned land "ik zal nooit mijn woord van eer er op geven dat ik niet eens beproeven zal om te ontvluchten"
0.062500, het midden der zaal stond eene rijk voorziene tafel kapitein nemo wees mij een stoel aan
0.100000, "ik gebruik nimmer het vleesch van landdieren" antwoordde de kapitein
0.076923, "deze zaal dient niet tot boekerij maar ook tot rookkamer" zeide de kapitein
0.019608, daarna opende kapitein nemo eene deur tegenover die waardoor wij de bibliotheek waren binnengetreden en ik trad een ruim en schitterend verlicht salon binnen het een groot vierkant met afgesneden hoeken tien meter lang zes breed en vijf hoog een zacht maar zeer helder licht viel van een rijk met ar0.023257, abesken beschilderd plafond op al de wonderen welke dit museum opeen waren gestapeld want het waarlijk een museum waarin eene ervaren en rijke hand al de schatten van natuur en kunst bijeengebracht op eene wijze welke de kunstmatige verwarring van een schildersatelier kenmerkt
0.043478, "mijnheer de professor" antwoordde de kapitein "mijne electriciteit niet de gewone welk elkeen kent dit alles wat ik er u van kan zeggen"
0.019231, "ja mijnheer met kwik vermengd vormt het een amalgama dat de bunsensche elementen het zink kan vervangen het kwik wordt nooit opgelost dit slechts het geval met het sodium doch dit levert de zee mij telkens weder op bovendien moet ik u zeggen dat de sodiumzuilen als zeer sterk werkend moeten bescho0.062500, uwd worden en dat hare electrieke kracht dubbel zoo groot als die van zuilen van zink"
0.019231, "ik weet niet zij die wel zullen vinden" antwoordde de kapitein koel "hoe het ook zij gij kent nu het voornaamste gebruik hetwelk ik van deze kracht maak zij verlicht ons met eene gelijkmatigheid en een duur welke het zonlicht niet bezit ziehier dit uurwerk het electriek en loopt regelmatiger dan d0.021277, e beste chronometers ik heb het op de italiaansche wijze vierentwintig uren verdeeld want voor mij bestaat geen dag nacht geen zon maan maar alleen dit kunstlicht dat ik tot de diepten der zee met mij kan medevoeren zie op dit oogenblik het tien uur den morgen"
0.142857, "daarlangs bereikt men de sloep" zeide hij
0.333333, "begrepen" antwoordde ik
0.018520, "als dus de nautilus drijft" vervolgde de kapitein "dan steekt zij voor een tiende deel boven water uit wanneer ik dus vergaarbakken heb aangebracht welke even groot van inhoud zijn als dit tiende gedeelte dat van 15002 ton en als ik die met water vul dan zal het vaartuig geheel onder water zijn di0.028571, t gebeurt mijnheer de professor die vergaarbakken bestaan het benedenste deel van de nautilus ik heb de kranen slechts te openen de ruimte wordt gevuld en het schip drijft juist onder de oppervlakte des waters"
0.250000, "dit duidelijk" antwoordde ik
0.062500, "ongeloofelijk rijk mijnheer ik zou zelfs zonder moeite de geheele nationale schuld van frankrijk kunnen betalen"
0.020408, plotseling werd het dag aan weerszijden van de zaal door twee ovale openingen het zeewater helder verlicht door een stroom electriek licht twee dikke glasschijven scheiden ons van de zee eerst sidderde ik op de gedachte dat deze broze wanden konden breken maar stevige koperen stangen steunden het g0.125000, las en gaven daaraan een bijna onbeperkt weerstandsvermogen
0.071429, "welnu vriend koen noem ze dan eens op als gij kunt" vroeg ned land
0.020408, en inderdaad die brave jongen altijd met zijn klassenindeeling de weer doch volstrekt geen natuurkenner ik weet niet hij wel een schelvisch van een schol kunnen onderscheiden kortom hij het tegendeel van ned land die al de visschen zonder aarzelen opnoemde met hun beiden zouden zij een volmaakt ich0.333333, thyoloog hebben gevormd
0.030303, dien dag begon ik het verhaal van mijne lotgevallen op te schrijven waardoor ik ze nu met de grootste nauwkeurigheid kan mededeelen opmerkenswaardig het dat ik op papier schreef hetwelk uit zeegras gemaakt
0.200000, "onderzeesche bosschen" riep ik uit
0.031250, "in die lantaarn een glazen buis welke koolstofgas bevat als het toestel werking dan begint dit gas te lichten en geeft een aanhoudenden en witten schijn zoo adem en zoo zie ik"
0.023810, "gij geeft op al mijne vragen zulke afdoende antwoorden kapitein dat ik niet meer durf te twijfelen doch als ik moet gelooven aan uwe toestellen van rouquayrol en ruhmkorff dan twijfel ik toch nog aan het geweer waarmede gij mij wilt wapenen"
0.022222, "omdat het geene gewone kogels zijn maar kleine glazen bolletjes door den oostenrijkschen scheikundige leniebrock uitgevonden en waarvan ik een aanzienlijken voorraad heb zij zijn met ijzer omkleed terwijl er een klein stukje lood aan bevestigd het zijn als 't ware kleine leidsche flesschen waarin 0.020000, de electriciteit tot op groote spanning opeengehoopt bij den geringsten schok ontladen zij zich en het dier hoe groot het ook zij valt onmiddellijk dood ik voeg er nog bij dat die kogeltjes niet grooter zijn dan hagel van 4 en dat eene gewone geweerlading er een tiental kan bevatten"
0.111111, "men zal u niet noodzaken ned" zeide de kapitein
0.090909, "wel zeker ik volg mijnheer waar hij ook gaat" antwoordde koenraad
0.047619, deze volmaakte scaphanders verschilden zooals men ziet hemelsbreed van die gebrekkige duikertoestellen welke de 18e eeuw uitgevonden en zoo geprezen werden
0.055556, de matroos van de nautilus nam het dier op hing het den schouder en wij vervolgden onzen weg
0.019608, de kapitein zweeg richtte zich op stapte eenige malen op het plat heen en weder en kwam weder naar mij toe "wat de infusiediertjes aangaat" hernam hij "die millioenen beestjes die oneindig getal een droppel leven en waarvan er 800000 een milligram wegen zij spelen eene niet minder belangrijke rol z0.020834, ij nemen het zeezout op verzamelen als het ware de vaste bestanddeelen van het water en worden daardoor de wezenlijke vervaardigers van kalkgrond zij maken koralen en zeesterren en als dan de waterdroppel van zijne vaste bestanddeelen beroofd lichter wordt dan stijgt hij naar de oppervlakte neemt d0.020833, aar weder het zout tot zich dat na uitdamping des waters achterblijft wordt wederom zwaarder zakt en brengt aan de infusiediertjes nieuw voedsel aan van daar een aanhoudend op en nedergaande stroom altijd beweging altijd leven een veel krachtiger weelderiger onbeperkter leven als op het land een le0.034483, ven dat vooral ontluikt op den oceaan dat zooals men zegt voor den mensch een element des doods maar dat het element des levens voor millioenen dieren envoor mij"
0.019608, de nautilus bleef zuidoostelijke richting voortvaren en kwam op lengte den 1sten december den evenaar drie dagen later kregen wij na eene zeer snelle vaart welke zich door geen enkel voorval kenmerkte de markiezeneilanden het gezicht op drie kilometer afstand zag ik op 57' zb en 32' wl het hooge to0.020834, viiplateau van noukahiwa het voornaamste eiland van den aan frankrijk behoorenden archipel ik kon het met bosschen bekroonde gebergte slechts uit de verte beschouwen want kapitein nemo hield er niet van om dicht bij het land te komen de netten leverden ons daar evenals bij schoone visschen bijvoorb0.020833, eeld eene soort (choryphenen) met hemelsblauwe vinnen en gouden staart die heerlijker van smaak waren dan eenige visch op de wereld anderen geheel zonder schubben maar ook zeer lekker na deze schoone eilanden welke onder bescherming der fransche vlag staan achter ons te hebben gelaten doorliep de n0.021739, autilus van 4 tot 11 december ongeveer 2000 kilometer op deze vaart ontmoetten wij een onnoemelijk aantal inktvisschen zij behooren tot de koppootige dieren en werden vooral door de natuuronderzoekers der oudheid bestudeerd als men athenaeus gelooven wil werden zij door de rijken griekenland en geg0.021739, "wel 192000 jaren noodig geweest koen waardoor de tijdrekening van den bijbel wel wat langer wordt overigens er nog ontzaglijker tijdsverloop noodig geweest tot vorming van de steenkolen de wouden welke door zondvloeden zijn vernietigd en onder de aarde geraakt en tot afkoeling van de basaltrotsen 0.028572, maar ik voeg hier ten overvloede bij dat die dagen van den bijbel tijdvakken voorstellen en geene tijdruimte tusschen twee zonsopgangen want volgens den bijbel zelven dagteekent de zon niet eens van den eersten scheppingsdag"
0.032258, het dien dag kerstmis en het scheen mij toe dat ned land het zeer betreurde dat hij het bij de engelschen zoo hoog kerstfeest niet te midden der zijnen vieren kon
0.019608, maar op dit oogenblik dumont d'urville zonder iets van de reis van dillon te weten reeds vertrokken om elders het tooneel van de schipbreuk te zoeken en inderdaad men door een walvischvaarder gehoord dat er medailles en een kruis van den heiligen lodewijk handen van wilden van de louisiaden en gezi0.020833, en waren dumont d'urville kapitein van de astrolabe dus zee gestoken en liet twee maanden nadat dillon vanikoro verlaten het anker voor hobarttown vallen daar vernam hij welke de uitslag geweest van dillons onderzoekingen en verder hoorde hij dat zekere james hobbs stuurman van de union van calcutt0.035714, a eens op een eilandje aan wal gegaan dat op 18' zb en 30' ol lag en daar ijzeren staven en roode stoffen gezien welke de inlanders gebruikten
0.019608, nemo zeide verder niets doch wenkte mij om hem naar het salon te volgen de nautilus zonk eenige meters onder water en de wanden openden zich ik ijlde naar het glas en zag onder die koralen en andere zeegewassen overblijfselen van eene schipbreuk welke de dreggen niet hadden kunnen losrukken ijzeren0.038462,  werktuigen ankers kanonnen kogels een kaapstander een brok van een voorsteven kortom allerlei voorwerpen van vergane schepen welke de zee nu met hare levende bloemen overdekt
0.021278, die straat torres wordt even gevaarlijk beschouwd om de klippen die men er talrijk aantreft als om de woestheid der kustbewoners zij scheidt nieuwholland van nieuwguinea dit laatste eiland ruim 1600 kilometer lang en 520 breed en heeft eene oppervlakte van 640000 vierkante kilometer het ligt tussch0.027027, en 19' en 2' zb en tusschen 23' en 15' ol om twaalf uur toen de eerste stuurman de hoogte der zon nam zag ik de toppen van den owenstanleybergketen welke langzaam opliep en scherpe punten eindigde
0.020408, de nautilus kwam dus voor den ingang der gevaarlijkste zeestraat van den aardbodem waar de stoutmoedigste zeevaarders ter nauwernood door durven varen eene straat waar luiz paz de zich doorwaagde toen hij uit de stille zuidzee naar den indischen archipel ging en waar 1840 de korvetten van dumont d'0.034483, urville op het punt waren van met man en muis te vergaan hoewel de nautilus alle zeegevaren scheen te kunnen trotseeren zou zij met deze koraalriffen toch kennis maken
0.333333, "meent gij dat"
0.045455, "wij mogen eerst wel vragen die bosschen wildrijk zijn" zeide ik "en het wild er niet groot dat het den jager wegjaagt"
0.083333, "goed" antwoordde ik "daar gaat de onverzichtigheid van meester land weer beginnen"
0.125000, "koen wij moeten aan niets wanhopen" antwoordde ned
0.021739, onder het houden van dergelijke gesprekken drongen wij het sombere woud door en doorkruisten dit gedurende twee uur allerlei richtingen het toeval diende ons het vinden van eetbare planten en een van de nuttigste boomen uit de keerkringsstreken verschafte ons een kostbaar voedsel hetwelk aan boord 0.020833, ontbrak ik bedoel den broodboom die op het eiland gueboroar veelvuldig voorkomt deze boom onderscheidde zich van de andere door een rechten en 14 meter hoogen stam de top van bevalligen ronden vorm en droeg groote gelobde bladeren uit die bladerenkroon kwamen groote ronde vruchten van een decimeter0.020833,  lang welke uitwendig zoo met stekels bezet waren dat zij daardoor den schijn hadden van zeshoekig te zijn het een nuttige boom waarmede de natuur die streken waar het graan ontbreekt voorzien heeft en die zonder veel arbeid te vorderen gedurende acht maanden van het jaar vruchten geeft
0.100000, "gij zult eens zien mijnheer hoe lekker dit brood is"
0.200000, "laat ons die dan zoeken"
0.250000, "wat beklaagt gij u"
0.142857, "dat zijn nog maar vogels" zeide koenraad
0.018519, "o mijnheer" riep ned land wien de jagers woede naar het hoofd begon te stijgen "wat heerlijk wild vooral gestoofd wat voorraad voor de nautilus twee drie vijf voor den grond en als ik denk dat wij al dat vleesch zullen opeten en dat die gekken daar aan boord er niets van mede krijgen"
0.027778, 's avonds om zes uur waren wij weder op het strand onze sloep lag op hare gewone plaats de nautilus stak altijd als een lange klip op twee mijl van de kust boven de zee uit
0.200000, "hoeveel hebt gij er geteld"
0.021277, een van die opperhoofden dicht bij de nautilus gekomen en bekeek het vaartuig nauwkeurig het moest er een van hoogen rang zijn want hij eene mat van gedroogde banaanbladen om het lichaam geslagen welke met schitterende kleuren beschilderd ik zou hem gemakkelijk hebben kunnen neerschieten omdat hij 0.027027, zich binnen het bereik van mijn geweer bevond doch ik meende dat het beter om te wachten tot dat zij zich wezenlijk vijandig toonden tusschen europeanen en wilden past het dat europeanen zich verdedigen en nimmer aanvallen
0.111111, "ik zal den kapitein waarschuwen" zeide ik naar binnengaande
0.333333, "en de papoea's"
0.020000, "duizend duivels" riep hij "ik ben door den bliksem getroffen" die uitroep verklaarde mij alles het geene trapleuning meer maar een metalen ketting met electriciteit geladen welke tot op het plat ging ieder die er aan raakte kreeg een vreeslijken schok en zulk een schok zou doodelijk geweest zijn a0.029412, ls de kapitein dien geleider met den geheelen electrieken stroom van zijne machine geladen men kon letterlijk zeggen dat hij tusschen zijne aanvallers en zich een elektriek net gespannen waar niemand ongestraft heen kon
0.066667, "zal mijnheer het mij niet kwalijk nemen als ik hem een raad geef" vroeg koenraad
0.250000, "gij hebt gelijk koen"
0.019608, den volgenden morgen werd ik zonder hoofdpijn wakker tot mijne groote verbazing ik mijne kamer mijne makkers waren waarschijnlijk ook weder de hunne gebracht zonder er iets van gemerkt te hebben zij wisten evenmin als ik wat er gedurende den nacht gebeurd en ik kon slechts op een toeval rekenen om 0.166667, ooit achter dit geheim te komen
0.200000, "kan niets hem meer redden"
0.022727, echter weet ik wel dat de nautilus het bewoonde land nadert en dat als zich eenige kans op ontvluchten voordoet het wreed zou zijn mijn makkers aan mijn zucht naar het onbekende op te offeren ik zal hen moeten volgen misschien zelfs wel geleiden
0.020408, onze gezondheid bleef zeer goed de leefregel aan boord beviel mij wel en ik voor mij zou aan ned land gaarne al die veranderingen geschonken hebben die hij bij wijze van verzet dagelijks op onze spijskaart verzon bovendien behoefden wij al die gelijkmatige temperatuur zelfs geen verkoudheid te vree0.043478, op dat oogenblik verscheen de kapitein met zijn eersten stuurman hij wierp een blik op de kaart en keerde zich vervolgens tot mij
0.018868, "men vischt parels mijnheer de professor" zei de kapitein "in de golf van bengalen de indische zee de chineesche en japansche langs de kusten van zuidamerika de golf van panama en die van maar bij ceylon levert deze visscherij de meeste voordeelen op wij komen er zeker wat vroeg want de visschers k0.018868, omen niet maart aan de golf van manaar bijeen waar zij zich dan gedurende dertig dagen met hun driehonderd schuiten bezig houden om de schatten der zee naar boven te halen elke schuit bevat tien roeiers en evenveel visschers deze worden twee groepen verdeeld die om beurten tot op een diepte van twa0.041667, alf meter duiken terwijl zij een zwaren steen aan hun beenen hebben hangen en door middel van een touw aan de schuit verbonden blijven"
0.055556, "ik geloof dat de schaphanders zooals gij ze gebruikt bij zulk een visscherij grooten dienst zouden kunnen bewijzen"
0.090909, de kapitein zei dit op lossen toon en verliet den salon
0.071430, wat mij aangaat ik streek met de hand het voorhoofd waarop eenige zweetdroppels kleefden
0.090909, "familie der weekdieren klasse der koploozen orde der schaaldieren" mompelde koenraad
0.037037, "maar" zei ik "om op onze kostbare parels terug te komen ik geloof niet dat eenig vorst er ooit zulk een kostbare bezeten heeft als kapitein nemo"
0.018182, de sloep naderde het eiland manaar dat voor ons lag uitgestrekt kapitein nemo opgestaan en overzag de zee op een teeken lieten de matrozen het anker vallen doch behoefden den ketting slechts weinig te vieren daar de zee hier op zijn hoogst meter diep op deze plek lag een van de hoogste punten der o0.055556, esterbank de sloep zwaaide onmiddellijk voor het anker om door toedoen der ebbe die haar zeewaarts wilde stuwen
0.027027, terwijl de kapitein dit zeide wendde ik mij naar ned land en koenraad maar zij hadden hun hoofd reeds den helm gestoken en konden dus niet hooren antwoorden ik richtte nog een laatste vraag tot den kapitein
0.032258, nu verlieten mij plotseling alle benauwende gedachten ik werd verwonderlijk kalm de gemakkelijkheid mijner bewegingen vermeerderde mijn gerustheid en het vreemde van het schouwspel maakte zich geheel van mijn geest meester
0.021277, op dit oogenblik opende zich voor ons een uitgestrekte grot uitgehold eene schilderachtige rots die met al de plantensoorten der onderzeesche flora scheen begroeid te zijn eerst meende ik dat die grot geheel donker de zonnestralen schenen er langzamerhand te verdwijnen en het licht dat er doorschee0.022222, n beteekende zeer weinig de kapitein trad de grot binnen wij volgden hem weldra gewenden mijne oogen zich aan die betrekkelijke duisternis ik onderscheidde de zonderling gevormde gewelven die door natuurlijke kolommen gedragen werden ze stonden op voeten van graniet evenals kolommen volgens de etru0.062500, rische bouworde waarom bracht onze onbegrijpelijke gids ons die onderzeesche grot ik zou het weldra zien
0.017242, tien minuten daarna hield de kapitein plotseling stil ik dacht dat hij staan bleef om terug te keeren doch dit niet het geval en met een beweging van de hand beval hij ons naast hem een holte neer te hurken hij wees naar een punt het water en ik keek oplettend toe op vijf meter afstand verscheen ee0.029412, n schaduw die tot op den grond daalde de verontrustende gedachte aan de haaien schoot mij weer te binnen doch ik bedroog mij ditmaal althans hadden wij met dit zeemonster nog niet te doen
0.034483, op het oogenblik dat de haai den ongelukkigen visscher wilde aanvatten zag hij zijn nieuwen vijand en zich weer op den buik wentelend zwom hij ijlings naar dezen toe
0.027778, op een teeken van den kapitein gingen wij weer naar de oesterbanken en den reeds afgelegden weg nogmaals volgende kwamen wij na een half uur gaans bij het anker waaraan de sloep van den nautilus vastlag
0.333333, de roode zee
0.019608, "zonder twijfel" antwoordde de kapitein lachend "en dat opzicht zijn de nieuwere schrijvers niet veel verder dan de oude er zijn eeuwen noodig geweest om de kracht van den stroom na te gaan wie weet men honderd jaar wel een tweeden nautilus zien zal de wetenschap vordert slechts langzaam mijnheer a0.018519, "die phantast beweert dat die naam er aan gegeven werd na den doortocht der toen de egyptische pharao omgekomen de golven welke zich op mozes' bevel hem sloten 'ten teeken van dit wonder' zegt hij 'werd de zee rood en vermiljoen en men noemt haar sedert dien tijd niet anders dan de roode zee'"
0.200000, "en die plaats" vroeg ik
0.200000, "ja mijnheer verwondert u dat"
0.066667, "en hebt gij dien doorgang bij toeval ontdekt" vroeg ik hoe langer zoo meer verbaasd
0.500000, hoofdstuk xxix
0.052632, ik ging met ned land en koenraad op het plat zitten de oostkust door den vochtigen mist nauwelijks zichtbaar
0.200000, "ziet gij daar niets mijnheer"
0.111112, "dank u mijnheer" riep ned land met schitterende oogen
0.062500, "zoo" zei de amerikaan "veroorlooft dit dier zich ook al de weelde van lekker te zijn"
0.018182, de stuurman zei eenige woorden zijn vreemde taal en waarschuwde daarmee zijn mannen zeker om op hun hoede te zijn toen de dugong op 7 meter van ons af hield hij stil blies plotseling de lucht uit door zijn groote neusgaten die niet vooraan maar boven op zijn snuit geplaatst waren en snelde met een 0.200000, sprong plotseling op ons aan
0.019608, de nautilus voer de straat van jubal binnen die ons de golf van suez brengen moest ik zag duidelijk een hoogen berg die boven de kaap uitstak het de horeb en de op wiens top mozes god van aangezicht tot aangezicht gezien en dien men steeds voorstelt als door bliksemstralen omhuld
0.019231, kwart voor negen kwam het schip weer boven ik ging op het plat ongeduldig om door den tunnel te komen kon ik niet lang stil blijven staan en ademde de frissche zeelucht weldra bemerkte ik de duisternis een klein lichtje dat dof door den nevel schijnend op een kilometer voor ons zichtbaar
0.020408, de hut donker maar weldra ik aan de duisternis gewoon en toen zag ik ook den stuurman een krachtig man die de velgen van het rad vasthield buiten de hut de zee helder verlicht door de lantaarn die achter den stuurstoel aan de andere zijde van het plat stond
0.142857, "wij varen op haar oppervlakte vriend ned"
0.018519, "overdrijf nu niet meester land" hernam ik "wij hebben niets van den kapitein te vreezen maar ik deel ook niet het gevoelen van koenraad wij kennen het geheim van den nautilus en ik denk niet dat de kapitein door ons de vrijheid te schenken er gemakkelijk toe zal overgaan dat geheim door ons wereld0.333333, kundig te maken"
0.500000, "waarom niet"
0.027027, "omdat de kapitein zich niet ontveinzen kan dat wij niet alle hoop hebben opgegeven om onze vrijheid te herkrijgen en dat hij wel op zijn hoede zal zijn vooral als wij het gezicht der europeesche kust varen"
0.027778, het inderdaad de gewezen verblijfplaats van proteus den ouden herder der kudden van neptunus thans het eiland scarpanto tusschen rhodus en creta ik zag door het raam van den salon alleen de granietrotsen waarop het rust
0.019231, "verontrust u niet" zei de kapitein "het nikolaas van kaap matapan de visch bijgenaamd hij op al de cycladen goed bekend een voortreffelijk duiker het water zijn element en hij leeft er meer dan op het land want hij gaat onophoudelijk van het eene eiland naar het andere tot zelfs naar kreta"
0.125000, "en gij zeidet mijnheer de professor" vroeg hij
0.021740, "dat zeer waarschijnlijk mijnheer aronnax want sedert 1866 zijn er nog acht kleine lavaeilandjes tegenover de st nicolaas op paleakameni verrezen het dus waarschijnlijk dat nea en palea zich vrij spoedig zullen vereenigen indien den grooten oceaan de koralen landen vormen dan zijn het hier vulkanis0.083333, che uitbarstingen zie eens mijnheer wat er hier onder de eilanden geschiedt"
0.038462, ik stond plotseling op ik ik moet het bekennen weinig voorbereid op zulk een mededeeling ik den amerikaan willen antwoorden doch ik kon geen woord uitbrengen
0.018868, toen ik den salon doorliep kwam ik bij de deur die toegang verleende tot de hut van den kapitein tot mijn groote verwondering stond deze deur half open ik deed onwillekeurig een schrede achterwaarts als kapitein nemo zijn kamer kon hij mij zien toen ik evenwel geen enkel gerucht hoorde naderde ik d0.052632, e hut verlaten ik stiet de deur open en deed eenige schreden naar binnen altijd dezelfde ernstige kloosterachtige eenvoud
0.076923, "zoo mijnheer de professor ik zocht u kent gij de geschiedenis van spanje"
0.041667, "ik luister kapitein" zei ik niet wetende waar hij heen wilde en mij zelven afvragend het ook een zinspeling op onze vlucht zijn zou
0.018519, de kapitein stond op en verzocht mij hem te volgen ik den tijd gehad weer op mijn verhaal te komen ik gehoorzaamde de salon duisternis gehuld maar door de glazen zag ik het verlichte zeewater ik keek toe rondom den nautilus het water op een afstand van vijf honderd meter helder door de electrische 0.020000, lantaarn verlicht de bodem met fijn en helderwit zand bedekt mannen van de equipage met scaphanders aan waren bezig om half verrotte tonnen en stuk gevallen kisten te midden van zwarte wrakken op te ruimen uit de kisten en vaten vielen zilveren en gouden staven stapels piasters en edelgesteenten he0.030303, t zand er mee bedekt vervolgens kwamen de mannen met rijken buit beladen op den nautilus terug legden er hun vracht neer en begonnen opnieuw dien oogst van goud en zilver te innen
0.066667, "welnu om twaalf uur zullen wij het te weten komen als de zonshoogte wordt genomen"
0.090909, "onder den grond" riep ik uit "en de nautilus drijft nog"
0.333333, "hij drijft altijd"
0.032258, wij waren aan den voet van een boschje vrij zware drakenboomen genaderd die door de kracht hunner sterke wortels de rots gebroken hadden toen ned land uitriep "o mijnheer een bijennest"
0.100000, "een bijennest" antwoordde ik terwijl ik den schouder ongeloovig optrok
0.250018, "het water komt op"
0.037037, "misschien" zei koenraad "maar de nautilus kan enkel een bepaald aantal menschen bevatten en zou mijnheer ons niet eens kunnen zeggen wat het grootste aantal zijn kan"
0.333333, "hoe dat koen"
0.090909, "is het waar" vroeg koenraad "dat zij schepen kunnen doen zinken"
0.020000, men kan zich voorstellen welk gezicht de amerikaan bij deze zedeles trok het den moriaan gewasschen om zulk een reden aan een visscher te willen opgeven ned land keek den kapitein eens aan en begreep zeker niet wat hij zeggen wilde de kapitein echter gelijk de woeste en onnadenkende vervolgingszuch0.076923, t der walvischvaarders zal eens den laatsten walvisch uit den oceaan doen verdwijnen
0.033333, "dat zijn potvisschen vreeselijke dieren die ik soms bij troepen van twee en drie honderd ontmoet heb men heeft gelijk die monsters te vernielen omdat zij wreed en kwaadaardig zijn"
0.052632, de amerikaan ontzag zich niet de schouders op te halen deze beesten met spoorslagen aanvallen wie dat ooit gehoord
0.125000, "ik houd meer van mijn harpoen" hervatte ned
0.022727, den 15den maart kwamen wij op de hoogte der nieuwshetlandsche en der orkneyeilanden de kapitein deelde mij mede dat deze streken vroeger door een ontzaglijke menigte zeekalven werden bewoond maar dat engelsche en amerikaansche walvischvaarders hun verdelgingswoede de jongen en de wijfjes doodden en0.100000,  stilte des doods hadden verwekt waar vroeger leven en beweging
0.066667, de nautilus moest dus op zijn avontuurlijken tocht het midden van deze ijsvelden blijven steken
0.500000, "waarom ned"
0.052632, ik stond op dit oogenblik op het plat de kapitein beschouwde onzen toestand gedurende eenige minuten en zei toen
0.142858, "ik denk dat wij vast zitten kapitein"
0.076923, "gij denkt dus mijnheer aronnax dat de nautilus niet meer los kan komen"
0.111111, "komaan mijnheer de professor gij zijt van daag vindingrijk"
0.076923, "wij zullen er wel onder door komen als mijnheer het goedvindt" zei koenraad
0.023810, "alles dat nog al veel maar ik geloof niet dat wij onzen amerikaanschen vriend hadden kunnen beletten eenige van die prachtige exemplaren te harpoenen kapitein nemo zou daar zeer boos om zijn geworden want hij vergiet ongaarne het bloed van weerlooze dieren"
0.111111, "goed koen" zei ik "maar laat ons nu voortgaan"
0.018519, na een tijd lang te hebben staan kijken dacht ik er om terug te keeren het elf uur en als kapitein nemo een gunstig oogenblik voor waarnemingen wenschte ik daarbij te zijn ik verwachtte echter niet dat de zon zich dien dag zou vertoonen want de gezichteinder met dikke wolken bedekt het scheen alsof0.019231,  de zon dat ontoegankelijk punt van den aardbol voor stervelingen niet wilde aanwijzen ik ging echter naar den nautilus terug en volgde een smal voetpad dat den top der klip liep om half twaalf waren wij op de landingsplaats de kapitein zich met de sloep aan wal laten brengen met zijn instrumenten 0.026317, bij zich hij keek naar den noordelijken gezichteinder waar de zon haar korte loopbaan beschreef ik ging naast hem staan en wachtte zonder spreken het werd twaalf uur maar even als den vorigen dag bleef de zon onzichtbaar
0.034483, "het weer klaart wat op" zei hij "ik heb goeden moed na het ontbijt zullen wij aan land gaan om een geschikte plaats voor onze waarneming uit te kiezen"
0.020408, gedurende onzen overtocht zag ik tal van walvisschen drie soorten treft men de zuidelijke poolzee aan de engelschen noemen ze rightwhale humpback en fineback de eerste heeft geen rugvinnen de tweede groote plooien den buik en witachtige vinnen de derde geelbruin van kleur en de vlugste van alle wal0.020000, visschen men kan deze reusachtige dieren reeds de verte ontwaren aan het water dat zij tot aanmerkelijke hoogte opspuiten met een kracht die wolken van damp doet opgaan deze dieren dartelden het stille water zoodat ik begreep dat de poolzee hun een toevluchtsoord tegen de vijanden die hen met hevig0.500000, heid vervolgden
0.019231, ik ga de verwenschingen van ned land met stilzwijgen voorbij hij kon zich naar hartelust opwinden ik liet hem uitrazen zonder hem de rede te vallen wij wachtten zoo wat twintig minuten en luisterden naar elk gerucht toen de kapitein binnen kwam hij scheen ons niet te zien zijn gelaat dat gewoonlijk0.032258,  zoo kalm drukte nu eenige ongerustheid uit hij bekeek langzaam het kompas den manometer en wees met den vinger op een punt der wereldkaart daar waar de zuidelijke poolzee zich bevond
0.142857, "dat zijn wij mooi ontkomen" zei koenraad
0.020833, het licht het plafond uit en toch de salon schitterend verlicht dit kwam omdat de ijswanden het licht van de lantaarn krachtig terugkaatsten ik zou geen woorden kunnen vinden om de prachtige uitwerking der lichtstralen op die grillig gevormde ijsblokken te beschrijven elke hoek elke spleet elk kris0.020000, tal wierp een ander schijnsel van zich dat verschilde naarmate er gekleurde aderen door het ijs liepen het een mijn van de schitterendste edelgesteenten vooral waren het de blauwe lichtstralen van de saffier die zich aan het groen der smaragden paarden hier en daar het alsof er diamanten tusschen w0.034483, aren gestrooid zoodat het oog den glans ternauwernood kon verdragen het licht van de lantaarn werd honderd malen versterkt evenals het licht eener lamp door allerlei lenzen een vuurtoren
0.250000, "wat er" vroeg ik
0.500000, "en dan"
0.500000, "mijn boek"
0.200000, "zooals mijnheer goedvindt" antwoordde koenraad
0.062500, "voor stikken behoeven wij niet bang te zijn kapitein" antwoordde ik "want onze vergaarbakken zijn vol"
0.025000, "juist" hernam nemo "maar dat maar voor twee dagen genoeg wij zijn nu al zes en dertig uren onder water zoodat het zeer noodig de lucht den nautilus te ververschen tweemaal vier en twintig uren zal onze voorraad uitgeput zijn"
0.029412, "dat zal de peiling leeren ik zal den nautilus op den onderkant van den tunnel laten rusten en dan zullen mijn manschappen met hun scaphanders aan den ijsberg aan de minst dikke zijde aantasten"
0.034483, de kapitein ging heen een gesis onderrichtte mij weldra dat de waterbakken volstroomden de nautilus daalde langzaam en stuitte eindelijk op den ijsvloer op een diepte van 350 meter
0.041667, "mijnheer" antwoordde de amerikaan "ik zal u nu niet vervelen met mijn klaagliederen ik ben bereid om alles te doen voor het algemeen behoud"
0.029412, na twee uren van onafgebroken arbeid kwam ned land afgemat weer binnen zijn makkers en hij werden door anderen vervangen waartoe ook koenraad en ik behoorden de stuurman van den nautilus bestierde onzen arbeid
0.019608, dien dag den zesden na onze insluiting vond kapitein nemo dat het met houweelen en bijlen te langzaam ging en wilde hij de ijsbank die ons nog van de open zee scheidde doorstooten die man zijn kalmte en geestkracht behouden hij onderdrukte door zijn zielskracht zijn lichamelijk lijden hij dacht ber0.333333, ekende en handelde
0.020834, toen begonnen de pompen met de grootste macht het water uit de vergaderbakken te werpen na weinige minuten kwam het vaartuig tot stilstand en wees de manometer aan dat wij rezen de schroef werkte met verbazende snelheid zoodat de nautilus onder de krachtige bewegingen trilde wij gingen noordwaarts
0.018868, plotseling kwam ik weer bij zinnen een zuivere lucht drong mijn longen waren wij aan de oppervlakte waren wij eindelijk onder de ijsbank uit neen het waren ned en koenraad mijn twee wakkere vrienden die zich opofferden om mij te redden van de toestellen bleef nog een beetje lucht plaats van dit voo0.022727, r zich te behouden hadden zij het voor mij bewaard en terwijl zij zelven bijna stikten goten zij mij het leven ik wilde het toestel van mij afstooten doch zij hielden mij de handen vast en ik ademde eenige oogenblikken met het grootste genot
0.055556, "vrienden" antwooidde ik hevig aangedaan "wij zijn voor altijd aan elkander verbonden en gij hebt recht op mij"
0.018519, hierop kon ik geen antwoord geven en ik vreesde dat de kapitein ons eer naar dien grooten oceaan zou terugvoeren die de kusten van en amerika bespoelt hij volbracht aldus zijn onderzeesche reis om de aarde en keerde naar die zee terug waar de nautilus zijn volkomen vrijheid vond doch als wij naar d0.020001, e stille zuidzee terugkeerden ver van eenig bewoond land wat werd er dan van ned lands plannen binnen kort zouden wij omtrent dit belangrijk punt zijn ingelicht want de nautilus vorderde hard weldra waren wij den poolcirkel en zetten regelrecht koers naar kaap hoorn wij waren den 31sten maart tegen0.083333,  zeven uur 's avonds op de hoogte van de zuidpunt van amerika
0.050001, "help mijnheer help mij" riep hij het de eerste maal dat de arme jongen mij niet den derden persoon aansprak
0.043478, "welnu" zei ik "dat zijn de ware grotten voor inktvisschen en het zou mij niet verwonderen als wij eenige van die monsters zagen"
0.025000, "dat spijt mij" hernam koen "ik zou van aangezicht tot aangezicht wel eens een van die inktvisschen willen zien waarover ik zoo dikwijls heb hooren spreken en die heele schepen naar de diepte kunnen slepen die beesten noemt men krakens"
0.100000, "zonder twijfel maar sommigen gelooven er zonder twijfel nog aan"
0.100000, ik keek koenraad aan ned land vloog naar het venster
0.020408, ik zeide dat de kapitein weende toen hij de zee beschouwde hij erg aangedaan het zijn tweede makker dien hij sinds onze komst aan boord verloor en welk een dood deze vriend verpletterd verstikt elkander gedrukt door den vreeselijken arm van den inktvisch wellicht later tusschen de ijzerharde kaken 0.066669, verbrijzeld en zou niet met zijn makkers rusten onder het kalme water een koralen graf
0.019608, het inderdaad een stroom die vrij te midden van den atlantischen oceaan golft en wiens water zich bijna niet met dat van de wereldzee vermengt het een stroom van zout water veel zouter dan dat van den omringenden oceaan de gemiddelde diepte een kilometer de breedte zestig kilometer op sommige plaat0.040000, sen bereikt de stroom een snelheid van vier kilometer het uur de onveranderlijke watermassa grooter dan die van alle stroomen van den aardbol bij elkander
0.200000, "wanneer" vroeg de amerikaan aandringend
0.333333, "u spreken kapitein"
0.043478, "welke mijnheer" vroeg hij op spottenden toon "hebt gij een ontdekking gedaan die mij nog ontgaan heeft de zee u nieuwe geheimen geopenbaard"
0.050000, "dat als alle eieren uitkwamen vier kabeljauwen genoeg waren om engeland amerika en noorwegen van een voldoenden voorraad te voorzien"
0.019231, plaats van verder noordwaarts te varen ging de nautilus meer naar het oosten alsof hij de richting van den telegraafkabel wilde volgen den 17den mei zag ik op ongeveer 500 kilometer van newfoundland en op een diepte van 2800 meter den kabel op den grond liggen koenraad dien ik niet gewaarschuwd zag0.023810,  het ding eerst voor een reusachtige zeeslang aan en wilde het op zijn gewone wijze een klasse indeelen doch ik hielp hem spoedig uit zijn dwaling en om hem te troosten vertelde ik hem verscheidene bijzonderheden van het leggen van dien kabel
0.020408, ik verwachtte wel dat ik den telegraafkabel niet zijn oorspronkelijken toestand terug zou zien zooals hij uit de fabriek gekomen de lange slang bedekt met schelpen en geheel bekleed met een korst van steenachtige kalk haar beschermend tegen weekdieren die er soms gaatjes konden boren de kabel lag s0.019608, til zonder iets te gevoelen van de beweging der zee en onder een drukking welke gunstig werkt op het overbrengen der electrische vonken van amerika naar europa 32/100 van een seconde de kabel kan oneindig lang duren want men heeft opgemerkt dat het omkleedsel van guttapercha beter wordt door het ze0.017857, ewater bovendien ligt de kabel op dit zoo gelukkig gekozen plateau nimmer op zulk een diepte dat hij kan breken de nautilus volgde hem tot op de grootste diepte 4431 meter en daar zag ik hem nog liggen zonder dat hij gespannen scheen te zijn daarop naderden wij de plaats waar 1863 het ongeluk met d0.200000, en tweeden kabel plaats gehad
0.066667, ik verliet hem en ging naar het plat waar koen en de amerikaan reeds waren
0.166667, "als mijnheer het niet kwalijk neemt"
0.333333, "welk schip het"
0.019231, om elf uur verscheen weer het electrisch licht ik ging den salon deze verlaten ik raadpleegde verschillende instrumenten de nautilus voer naar het noorden met een snelheid van vijfentwintig kilometer het uur dan eens op dan tien meter onder de zee op de kaart ziende bemerkte ik dat wij door het kan0.020000, aal met een onvergelijkelijke snelheid naar de noordzee liepen wij voeren zoo snel dat ik nauwelijks de menigte visschen kon onderscheiden tusschen welke wij doorvlogen 's avonds hadden wij 300 kilometer afgelegd het werd duister en de zee somber totdat de maan opkwam ik ging naar mijn kamer doch k0.052634, on niet slapen want ik werd door benauwde droomen gekweld telkens kwam mij dat vreeselijk vernielingstooneel voor den geest
0.166667, "wij zullen te zamen sterven ned"
0.028571, "wij zullen elkander ons vertrek niet terug zien om tien uur de maan nog niet op daarom zullen wij dan van de duisternis gebruik maken kom dan de sloep koen en ik wachten u daar"
0.030303, de opening het pantser van den nautilus werd eerst gesloten daarna de opening de sloep en toen begon ned land de schroeven los te draaien welke ons nog aan het onderzeesche vaartuig vasthechtten
