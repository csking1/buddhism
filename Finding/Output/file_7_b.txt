0.021740, het weer bleef echter goed en de reis werd onder de gunstigste omstandigheden voortgezet het slechte jaargetijde anders die streken ingevallen want de maand juli komt daar met onze maand januari overeen maar de zee bleef kalm en men kon haar tot op grooten afstand overzien
0.052632, "komaan koen" zeide ik "nu hebt gij voor het laatst de gelegenheid om 2000 dollars uw zak te steken"
0.125000, "welnu dan heeft mijnheer slechts wat hij verdient"
0.076923, "ned land" vroeg de kapitein "hebt gij dikwijls het geblaas van walvisschen gehoord"
0.027778, drie hoezee's volgden op dit bevel het uur van den strijd geslagen eenige oogenblikken later braakten de beide schoorsteenen van het fregat wolken zwarten rook uit en het dek trilde onder de heftige beweging der machine

0.045455, om twaalf uur waren wij niet verder dan om acht uur 's morgens toen besloot kapitein farragut andere middelen aan te wenden
0.200000, "gij hebt gelijk" antwoordde ik

0.083333, "neen mijnheer maar daar ik mijnheers dienst ben ben ik mijnheer gevolgd"
0.142857, de brave jongen vond dit zeer natuurlijk
0.020408, "ja ja" en koenraad riep nogmaals op wanhopigen toon ditmaal vergisten wij ons niet eene menschelijke stem gaf ons antwoord het de stem van een ongelukkige eenig ander slachtoffer van den schok dien het fregat ondervonden het wellicht eene sloep van de abraham lincoln die ons de duisternis zocht
0.029412, op dit oogenblik stiet ik op een hard voorwerp ik klampte mij er aan vast toen voelde ik dat men mij optrok en uit het water haalde ik haalde ruimer adem en viel zwijm
0.090909, "omdat dit beest mijnheer de professor van stalen platen gemaakt is"
0.021277, wij behoefden evenwel niet te aarzelen wij bevonden ons boven op een soort van onderzeesch vaartuig dat voor zoover als ik er kan oordeelen den vorm van een metalen visch ned land er zijn meening reeds gevormd koenraad en ik konden er zoo spoedig niet toe komen

0.071429, "bedaar vriend ned" zeide ik tot den woedenden harpoenier "uw toorn leidt tot niets"
0.019608, overigens begreep ik dat ned lands verbittering toenam naarmate zijne overdenkingen zich geheel van zijne drift meester maakten ik hoorde hem nu en dan half verstaanbare vloeken mompelen en ik zag dat hij op nieuw dreigende gebaren maakte hij stond op liep als een wild dier eene kooi rond en stampt0.018868, e met handen en voeten tegen den muur bovendien verliep de tijd de honger deed zich erg gevoelen en de hofmeester verscheen nog niet als men ons goed wilde behandelen dan vergat men ons ongelukkige schipbreukelingen toch wat al te lang ned land wiens sterke maag hem begon te plagen werd hoe langer 0.019608, hoe driftiger en hoewel hij mij zijn woord gegeven vreesde ik inderdaad eene uitbarsting als hij een van de equipage onder handen kon krijgen zijn toorn vermeerderde nog gedurende twee lange uren hij riep en schreeuwde maar te vergeefs de ijzeren muren waren doof ik hoorde geen het minste geluid he0.020000, t vaartuig welks bemanning dood scheen te zijn het schip bewoog zich niet anders zou ik de trillingen wel bemerkt hebben welke het draaien eener schroef veroorzaakt het zonder twijfel de diepte der zee afgedaald en behoorde niet meer tot deze aarde die doodsche stilte vreeselijk ik durfde er zelfs 0.021277, niet naar te raden hoe lang onze verlatenheid onze eenzaamheid nog duren zou langzamerhand verdwenen de verwachtingen welke ik na onze ontmoeting met den kapitein gekoesterd de zachte blik van dien man de edelmoedige uitdrukking van zijn gelaat de waardigheid zijne houding dit alles verdween uit mi0.021277, jne herinnering ik beschouwde het raadselachtige wezen slechts als onmeedoogend en wreed ik stelde mij hem voor als onmenschelijk ongevoelig voor eenig medelijden hard jegens zijne medemenschen aan wie hij een eeuwigen haat scheen te hebben gezworen maar zou die man ons van honger doen sterven opge0.021739, sloten deze enge gevangenis en overgegeven aan die vreeselijke gedachten welke woedende honger bij den mensch soms opwekt dit ontzettende denkbeeld kwam langzamerhand bij mij tot rijpheid en mijne verbeelding gevoelde ik dat eene onzinnige vrees mij bekroop koenraad bleef kalm ned land brulde nu en0.333333,  dan van woede
0.021277, ik bemerkte de woorden een kwalijk bedwongen toorn maar op die beschuldigingen ik een zeer natuurlijk antwoord en ik gaf dit deze woorden "gij weet zeker niet mijnheer welke twistvragen er amerika en europa ten uwen opzichte gerezen zijn gij weet waarschijnlijk niet dat verschillende ongelukken die0.021739,  het gevolg waren van botsingen met uw onderzeesch vaartuig de openbare meening beide werelddeelen hevig geschokt hebben ik zal u niet vermoeien met al de veronderstellingen welke men maakte om daarmede het onverklaarbare verschijnsel te verklaren waarvan gij alleen het geheim bezit maar gij zult m0.025000, ij wel willen gelooven als ik u verzeker dat toen de abraham lincoln u het noorden der stille zuidzee vervolgde wij een sterk zeemonster meenden na te jagen van hetwelk men den oceaan het kostte wat het wilde moest verlossen"
0.050000, ik antwoordde niets en met reden waarom zou ik zulke woorden twisten als het geweld de beste bewijsgronden smoren kan
0.058824, "eene laatste vraag" zeide ik op het oogenblik dat dit onverklaarbare wezen weg scheen te willen gaan
0.500000, hoofdstuk xi
0.333332, alles door electriciteit
0.090909, "en die andere instrumenten welker gebruik ik zelfs niet kan raden"
0.142860, "de electriciteit" riep ik ten hoogste verbaasd
0.020408, "ik zal ook niet onbescheiden zijn kapitein en ik zal mij vergenoegen met mijne verbazing zulk een resultaat te uiten eene enkele vraag evenwel waarop gij niet behoeft te antwoorden als ik onbescheiden ben de elementen welke gij voor die wonderbare kracht bezigt moeten spoedig verbruikt zijn hoe bi0.066667, jvoorbeeld vervangt gij het zink omdat gij geene gemeenschap meer houdt met het bewoonde land"
0.333333, "aan de zee"
0.022728, ik volgde den kapitein door de loopgangen aan bakboord en ik kwam het midden van het vaartuig daar eene soort van put tusschen twee ondoordringbare beschotten eene ijzeren trap aan den wand vastgeschroefd leidde naar het bovenste gedeelte ik vroeg waarvoor die trap diende
0.033333, deze helder verlichte machinekamer niet minder dan twintig meter lang zij twee deelen afgedeeld het eerste bevatte de elementen het tweede de werktuigen welke de beweging aan de schroef mededeelden
0.500000, hoofdstuk xiii
0.020409, de kapitein sprak met wegslepende welsprekendheid het vuur van zijn blik het levendige van zijne gebaren maakten een ander mensch van hem ja hij zijn vaartuig lief als een vader zijn kind maar eene misschien onbescheiden vraag rees nu bij mij op en ik kon die ook niet terughouden
0.020000, de zee kalm en de hemel helder het lange vaartuig voelde nauwelijks iets van de zachte schommelingen van den oceaan een licht oostewindje rimpelde het watervlak de gezichteinder zonder nevels en liet dus de beste opmetingen toe er niets het gezicht geen klip geen eiland geen abraham lincoln niets d0.250000, an de oneindige ruimte
0.058824, "met mijnheers goedvinden zou ik eer zeggen dat het bij ons de galeries de was" zeide koenraad
0.038462, "ik moet mijnheer gelooven omdat hij het verzekert" zeide koenraad "maar op mijn woord de zaal zoo schoon dat zij zelfs een vlaming als mij verbaast"
0.018519, gedurende dien tijd vroeg ned land die niets met schelpen ophad mij naar mijn onderhoud met den kapitein ik ontdekt wie hij van waar hij kwam waar hij heenging naar welke diepte hij ons medesleepte kortom duizenden vragen waarop ik zelfs den tijd niet een antwoord te geven ik vertelde hem al wat ik0.058824,  wist liever wat ik niet wist en ik vroeg hem wat hij van zijn kant gezien gehoord
0.027778, wij bleven verstomd staan en bewogen ons niet daar wij niet wisten welke aangename onaangename verrassing ons wachtte doch een schuiven deed zich hooren men zou gezegd hebben dat de zijwanden van de nautilus beweging kwamen
0.166667, "ik een visscher" zeide ned land
0.020001, den volgenden dag 10 november bracht ik even afgezonderd en verlaten door ik zag niemand van de equipage ned en koenraad brachten het grootste gedeelte van den dag met mij door zij verwonderden zich de onverklaarbare afwezigheid van den kapitein de zonderlinge man ziek wilde hij zijne plannen ten o0.022222, nzen opzichte wijzigen overigens genoten wij volgens koenraad geheel onze vrijheid en wij werden uitstekend gevoed onze gastheer hield zich nauwkeurig aan de voorwaarden van onze overeenkomst wij konden ons niet beklagen en bovendien vonden wij het zonderlinge van ons lot zulk eene schoone vergoedi0.083333, ng dat wij het recht nog niet hadden om hem te beschuldigen
0.250000, "eene jachtpartij" riep ned
0.090909, "en de bosschen van het eiland crespo" voegde koenraad er bij
0.052632, "indien kapitein nemo soms aan land gaat" zeide ik "dan kiest hij ten minste eilanden die volkomen verlaten zijn"
0.125000, "maar kapitein gij zult toch niet gelooven dat"
0.090910, "het geen gewoon geweer met kruit en lood" antwoordde de kapitein
0.250000, "dat zult gij zien"
0.020408, de kapitein zette zijn helm op welk voorbeeld koen en ik volgden terwijl wij nog hoorden dat de harpoenier ons spottenderwijze een goede jacht toewenschte ons kleed eindigde van boven een koperen kraag waarop de helm kon worden vastgeschroefd drie gaten met dik glas voorzien lieten het uitzicht naa0.016949, r alle kanten vrij als men het hoofd binnen den helm slechts omdraaide zoodra de helm vast zat begon het toestel van rouquayrol dat ik op den rug te werken en wat mij aangaat ik ademde geheel vrij met de lamp aan den gordel en het geweer de hand ik gereed om te vertrekken maar om ronduit te spreken0.021277,  die zware kleederen opgesloten en door mijn looden zolen als aan den grond genageld kon ik onmogelijk een stap doen dit evenwel voorzien en ik voelde mij naar een klein vertrek naast de kleedkamer voortduwen mijne makkers volgden mij evenzoo voortgetrokken ik hoorde een met sluitstukken voorziene 0.018868, deur achter ons dicht gaan en eene diepe duisternis omringde ons na eenige minuten hoorde ik een scherp gefluit ik voelde iets kouds langs mijne beenen naar boven stijgen ik begreep dat men door eene kraan het zeewater dit vertrek liet dringen en weldra de ruimte er geheel mede gevuld toen opende z0.040000, ich een tweede deur welke op zijde de nautilus gemaakt een schemerlicht omgaf ons en weinige oogenblikken later stonden wij op den bodem der zee
0.019608, weldra begon ik eenige voorwerpen te zien welker vorm door den afstand nog niet duidelijk geweest ik herkende prachtige rotsen met de schoonste bedekt doch daarbij trof mij eene zonderlinge uitwerking van het licht het toen ongeveer tien uur den morgen de stralen der zon vielen vrij schuin op zee h0.022222, et licht werd door terugkaatsing evenals wanneer het door een prisma valt ontbonden zoodat bloemen rotsen planten schelpen polypen kortom alles met de zeven kleuren van het zonnespectrum schitterde het een wonder verrukkelijk voor het oog die dooreenmenging en schakeering van kleuren een ware kalei0.019608, doskoop van groen geel oranje paarsch blauw een woord het geheele palet van een dollen schilder hoezeer speet het mij dat ik aan koenraad mijne levendige indrukken niet kon mededeelen en dat ik met hem niet kon wedijveren uitroepen van verbazing waarom kon ik niet evenals kapitein nemo met zijn mak0.026316, ker door teekens mijne gedachten mededeelen bij gebrek aan beter praatte ik dus maar tot mij zelven ik schreeuwde de koperen doos waarin mijn hoofd besloten en gebruikte met mijne ijdele woorden mogelijk meer lucht dan ik mocht
0.019231, eindelijk waren wij aan den rand gekomen van het woud dat zeker een der schoonsten van het uitgestrekte gebied van kapitein nemo hij beschouwde het als het zijne en matigde zich dezelfde rechten daarover aan als de eerste menschen de eerste tijden na de schepping op alles hadden wie zou hem bovendi0.037040, en het bezit van dit onderzeesche gebied betwist hebben welk ander zou even stoutmoedig als hij met de bijl de hand het sombere woud zijn komen ontginnen
0.020833, weldra raakte ik gewoon aan dien zonderlingen stand der gewassen evenals aan de betrekkelijke duisternis welke ons omringde de grond het woud met scherpe blokken bezaaid welke wij moeielijk konden vermijden de onderzeesche flora scheen mij hier vrij volledig te zijn en zelfs rijker dan zij het noor0.030303, delijke keerkringsstreken doch gedurende eenige minuten warde ik planten en dieren dooreen en wie zou zich daarin niet bedrogen hebben daar de fauna en de flora elkander die onderzeesche wereld zoo nabij komen
0.047620, geen goeden morgen goeden avond zou men niet gezegd hebben dat die vreemde man een reeds begonnen gesprek met mij vervolgde
0.019608, den nacht van 9 op 10 december ontmoette de nautilus een heirleger van weekdieren welke vooral bij nacht beweging zijn men kon ze bij millioenen tellen zij verhuisden van de gematigde naar warmere luchtstreken en volgden dus dat opzicht de gewoonte der haringen en sardijnen wij zagen ze door het gl0.021739, as zeer snel achteruit zwemmen en visschen vervolgen de kleinere opeten doch zelve wederom door de grootere verslonden terwijl zij onbeschrijfelijke verwarring de tien pooten bewogen welke de natuur hun op den kop als een haarbos van slangen heeft ingeplant niettegenstaande hare snelheid voer de na0.032258, utilus gedurende eenige uren door de menigte dieren waarvan een aantal de netten gevangen werden en waaronder ik de negen verschillende soorten herkende welke d'orbigny voor den grooten oceaan heeft opgegeven
0.058824, "zal ik dan die beruchte eilanden kunnen bezoeken waar de boussole en de astrolabe te gronde gingen"
0.021277, het noordoosten zag ik twee vulkanische eilanden van ongelijke grootte omringd door een koraalrif dat veertig kilometer omtrek wij waren bij het eigenlijk gezegde vanikoro waaraan dumont d'urville den naam van onderzoekeiland gaf en lagen juist voor de kleine van vanou het eiland scheen van het str0.041667, and tot op de bergtoppen binnenslands met groen bedekt te zijn het midden verhief zich de berg kapogo die eene hoogte van 950 meter
0.047619, "maar een toeval" hernam ik "dat u misschien verplichten zal om het land dat gij zoozeer ontvlucht weder te gaan bewonen"
0.023256, "ik vertrouw het maar half" zeide koenraad "komaan op de jacht wij moeten volstrekt een stuk wild schieten om dien kannibaal tevreden te stellen anders zal mijnheer op een morgen niets anders vinden dan wat brokken van een knecht om hem te bedienen"
0.055556, "eet er van op uw gemak vriend ned wij zijn hier om alles te beproeven doe het dus"
0.125000, "en hoe maakt gij die gereed" vroeg ik
0.021739, en inderdaad onder het dichte gebladerte fladderde een heirleger van papegaaien van tak tot tak zij schenen slechts op een zorgvuldiger opvoeding te wachten om te kunnen spreken voor het oogenblik kakelden zij met wijfjes van allerhande kleur en met deftige kakatoe's die eenige wijsgeerige stelling0.021739,  schenen na te denken terwijl schitterend roode vogels als een stuk scharlaken dat door den wind wordt voortgejaagd voorbij vlogen te midden van een vogelenheir dat met de prachtigste kleuren uitgedost het eene verscheidenheid van bevallige vogels zooals ik nooit gezien doch die het algemeen slecht0.037037,  om te eten waren evenwel ontbrak er aan deze verzameling nog vogel welke nooit de grenzen van de papoeaeilanden gekomen het toeval diende mij weldra ook hierin
0.029412, "laat ons de jacht dan voortzetten" antwoordde koenraad maar naar den zeekant toe wij zijn tot de helling der bergen genaderd en ik geloof dat het beter om naar de bosschen terug te keeren
0.020833, om kort te gaan ons maal overheerlijk twee houtduiven kwamen ook op de spijskaart voor en behalve dit en de andere vleeschspijzen eene sagopastij brood van den broodboom eenige manga's een half dozijn ananassen en het uitgegiste sap van zeker soort van kokosnoten waardoor wij wat opgewonden werden 0.076923, ik geloof zelfs dat mijne waardige makkers niet zoo heel helder meer waren
0.055556, een tweede zuiver ronde steen sloeg koenraad een lekker duivenboutje uit de hand en bevestigde dus zijne opmerking
0.019608, en er wel reden toe men weet toch dat rechts wenden volgens de opmerkingen der natuuronderzoekers een wet van de natuur de hemellichamen en hunne wachters bewegen zich bij hunne omwenteling om de zon en om zich zelven van rechts naar links de mensch gebruikt liefst de rechterhand zoodat allerlei we0.020833, rktuigen en inrichtingen als trappen sloten horlogeveeren enz enz zoodanig gemaakt zijn dat zij rechts kunnen gebruikt worden de natuur heeft deze wet ook gevolgd het draaien der schelpen zij zijn allen rechts op zeer zeldzame uitzonderingen na en als er soms gevonden worden die links gedraaid zijn0.100001,  dan betalen de liefhebbers die soms met haar gewicht goud
0.055556, "niets gemakkelijker" zeide nemo en op een electrieken knop drukkende gaf hij daartoe aan de wachthebbende matrozen bevel
0.500000, "welk mijnheer"
0.200000, "heeft mijnheer mij niet noodig"
0.066667, "ik heb de proeven genomen" zeide hij "en ik kan de zekerheid mijner gegevens bevestigen"
0.019231, "gij weet mijnheer dat het zeewater meer dichtheid bezit dan het zoetwater maar die dichtheid niet overal dezelfde als ik bij voorbeeld de dichtheid van zoetwater gelijk stel dan vind ik 1028 voor het water van den atlantischen en 1026 voor dat van den grooten oceaan 103 voor het water der middella0.500000, ndsche zee"
0.018868, de kapitein liep echter zonder mij aan te zien misschien zelfs zonder mijne tegenwoordigheid te bemerken op het plat heen en weder hij stapte met vaste schreden doch minder geregeld dan gewoonlijk het plat soms stond hij met de borst gekruiste armen stil en liet zijn blik de zee weiden wat zocht hi0.052632, j op die onmetelijke ruimte de nautilus bevond zich toen op eenige honderden kilometer van de naaste kust verwijderd
0.200000, "neen mijn jongen" antwoordde ik
0.250000, het rijk der koralen

0.500000, "kijk maar"
0.025001, de wanden openden zich en ik zag dat het water om den nautilus geheel wit zwaveldampen ontwikkelden zich de zee die als een ketel kookte ik hield mijn hand tegen het glas doch dit heet dat ik de hand terugtrok

0.250000, "van avond" zei hij
0.040000, op dat oogenblik gaf mij een vrij sterk geruisch te kennen dat de vergaarbakken van den nautilus vol liepen en wij weer de diepte daalden
0.018519, "de fransche admiraal zwak genoeg om toe te geven en de schepen liepen de baai van vigo binnen deze vormt een regelmatige open reede die moeilijk kon verdedigd worden men moest zich dus haasten de galjoenen te lossen voor dat de geallieerde vloten er de lucht van kregen en zij zouden ook tijd genoe0.040000, g voor dat lossen gehad hebben ware niet plotseling een ellendig geschil dat uit naijver ontsproot ontstaan gij volgt mij toch goed" vroeg de kapitein
0.020408, nu begreep ik alles hier het tooneel van den zeeslag van 22 october 1702 hier waren die voor rekening van de spaansche regeering geladen galjoenen gezonken hier kwam kapitein nemo naarmate van zijn behoeften de millioenen halen waarmee hij zijn nautilus bevrachtte het voor hem voor hem dat amerika 0.043478, zijn kostbare metalen opgebracht hij alleen en onverdeeld erfgenaam van die aan de incas en hun door ferdinand cortez onderworpen volken ontroofde schatten
0.100000, "die waren er" antwoordde kapitein nemo doch nu niet meer"
0.020408, die steenhoopen waarvan ik zooeven sprak waren op den zeebodem met een zekere regelmaat verspreid waarvan ik mij geen verklaring wist te geven ik zag reusachtige groeven die zich het duister verloren welker lengte ik niet kon schatten zoo merkte ik ook andere bijzonderheden op waarvan ik geen verkl0.020000, aring wist te geven het kwam mij voor dat mijn zware schoenzolen een veld met beenderen verbrijzelden die dof kraakten welke dan die uitgestrekte vlakte waar wij gingen ik het den kapitein willen vragen maar de teekens door middel waarvan hij met zijn makkers bij hun onderzeesche tochten sprak ware0.250000, n voor mij onbegrijpelijk
0.021277, onze weg werd langzamerhand lichter het witte licht straalde boven een berg van ongeveer 800 voet hoog maar wat ik zag eigenlijk niets als een eenvoudige terugkaatsing van licht tegen het kristal van water de bron van dat overklaarbaar licht aan de andere zijde van den berg
0.019231, welke die vreeselijke mij nog onbekende dierenwereld tot welke klasse orde behoorden deze beesten voor wie de rotsen waarop zij huisden als 't ware een tweede schaal vormden waar de natuur het geheim van hun bestaan ontdekt en sedert hoeveel eeuwen leefden zij de diepten van de zee doch ik kon niet0.020408,  blijven staan kapitein nemo meer van nabij met deze afzichtelijke wezens bekend sloeg er geen acht meer op wij waren op een eerste bergvlak gekomen waar mij nog andere verrassingen wachtten daar zag ik schilderachtige bouwvallen die de hand der menschen en niet des scheppers verrieden het waren gr0.035714, oote steenhoopen waaronder men onduidelijk de vormen van kasteelen en tempels herkende met een heirleger van bloeiende en een mantel van zeewier en gras als met klimop bedekt
0.017544, ik volgde hem dus en binnen weinige minuten ik den top bereikt die boven deze rotsmassa nog tien meter uitstak ik keek naar de zijde door ons bestegen de berg verhief zich slechts zeven acht honderd voet boven de vlakte maar aan de andere zijde hij dubbel zoo hoog en besloeg het dal dat zich dit ge0.020000, deelte van den oceaan aan zijn voeten uitstrekte mijn blik drong hier vrij ver door en omvatte een groote ruimte door een hevige uitbarsting verlicht deze berg inderdaad een vulkaan ongeveer vijftig voet onder den top braakte een krater te midden van een regen van steenen en rotsblokken stroomen la0.020409, va uit als vurige watervallen het water verdwijnend deze vulkaan verlichtte als een ontzaglijk groote fakkel de vlakte zoover het oog reikte ik zei dat die onderzeesche vulkaan lava maar geen vlammen uitbraakte voor vlammen de zuurstof der lucht noodig zoodat zij onder het water niet kunnen duren m0.023257, aar lavastroomen die het beginsel hunner gloeiing zich bevatten kunnen zelfs roodgloeiend zijn zegevierend tegen het water worstelen en dit bij aanraking verdampen de lava stroomde dus even als bij de uitbarstingen van den vesuvius naar beneden op een ander torre del greco
0.019231, den volgenden dag 20 februari stond ik zeer laat op de vermoeienissen van den nacht hadden mij tot elf uur doen slapen ik kleedde mij haastig want ik wilde weten welke richting de nautilus de instrumenten wezen aan dat wij altijd met een twintig kilometervaart op honderd meter diepte naar het zuide0.500000, n snelden
0.142857, "zijn uw mannen dan hier mijnwerkers kapitein"
0.018182, "ditmaal niet want ik heb haast om onze onderzeesche reis om de aarde te vervolgen ik zal mij derhalve tevreden stellen om wat mee te nemen van den vooraad sodium dien ik hier bewaar ik heb slechts dag noodig om een genoegzame hoeveelheid aan boord te nemen en dan zullen wij onze reis vervolgen wan0.047619, neer gij dus deze grot doorwandelen en eens om het meer heenloopen wilt maak dan gebruik van dezen dag mijnheer aronnax"
0.018868, "wel neen vrienden" antwoordde ik "het eenvoudig de vloed die ons heeft overvallen de zee buiten den berg rijst en de wetten van het evenwicht leeren dat het meer binnen den berg dan ook rijzen moet wij zijn er met een half nat pak afgekomen en zullen ons op den nautilus gaan verkleeden"
0.022222, de richting van den nautilus niet veranderd wij moesten voor het oogenblik dus alle hoop laten varen om naar eenige europeesche zee terug te keeren kapitein nemo bleef den koers naar het zuiden richten waar voerde hij ons heen ik kon het mij niet voorstellen
0.020408, gedurende de bovengemelde negentien dagen er op onze reis niets bijzonders plaats ik zag den kapitein maar zelden hij zat te werken dikwijls vond ik de bibliotheek boeken die hij geopend laten liggen en vooral werken natuurlijke geschiedenis mijn werk de diepten der zee door hem doorbladerd en met 0.020833, kantteekeningen overladen die mijn stellingen dikwijls weerspraken doch de kapitein stelde zich slechts tevreden met aldus mijn werk te verbeteren zonder met mij te twisten soms hoorde ik de droefgeestige tonen van zijn orgel dat hij met veel gevoel bespeelde maar altijd des nachts te midden van de0.055556,  grootste duisternis als de nautilus op de groote verlaten vlakte van den oceaan als ingeslapen scheen te zijn
0.200000, "wat wilt gij daarmee zeggen"
0.083333, ik keek ned land strak aan omdat zijn doel gemakkelijk te raden
0.043478, "doch gij kunt gerust aannemen" voegde ik er bij "dat passagiers en equipage bij elkander nog geen tiende deel van dit getal uitmaken"
0.055556, de amerikaan schudde het hoofd streek met de hand het voorhoofd sprak geen woord meer en ging heen
0.022727, het zeker dat de eentonigheid van het scheepsleven voor den amerikaan die aan een vrij en werkzaam leven gewoon onverdraaglijk zijn moest voorvallen die hem belang konden inboezemen vielen zelden voor echter herinnerde hem juist dien dag iets aan zijn schoone dagen als harpoenier
0.022222, "o" riep ned land "was ik maar eens aan boord van een walvischvaarder zulk een ontmoeting zou mij genoegen doen het een groot beest ziet eens met welk een kracht het de waterstralen opspuit duizend duivels waarom zit ik ook op deze ijzeren kast vastgeketend"
0.043478, "dan de zuidelijke walvisch je onbekend je hebt alleen jacht gemaakt op de noordelijke walvisschen die zich niet wagen de tusschen de keerkringen"
0.019231, "mijnheer zal u antwoorden" hervatte ik "dat de walvisschen volgens hun soorten bepaalde te huis behooren die zij niet verlaten en indien een van deze dieren uit de behring en de davisstraat gekomen dan dit heel eenvoudig omdat er een doorvaart van de eene zee naar de andere bestaat hetzij langs de0.142857,  noordkust van amerika hetzij langs die van
0.166667, "duizend jaar" antwoordde ned zonder aarzelen
0.038462, "o" riep hij uit "het niet walvisch het zijn er tien twintig een heele troep en niets kunnen doen aan handen en voeten gebonden te zijn"
0.200000, "ijs en nog eens ijs"
0.040000, "anders niet" vroeg ik "de nautilus heeft groote vergaarbakken wij zullen die vullen en deze kunnen ons al de zuurstof die wij noodig hebben verschaffen"
0.032258, "goed kapitein maar vergeet gij dat de nautilus met een geducht spoor gewapend en kunnen wij daarmee niet schuin tegen de ijsmassa rammelen om deze door den schok open te boren"
0.020000, ondertusschen werden er reeds toebereidselen voor deze koene onderneming gemaakt de krachtige pompen van den nautilus persten de lucht de vergaarbakken tegen vier uur deelde kapitein nemo mij mee dat het luik van het plat zou gesloten worden ik wierp een laatsten blik op de dikke ijsbank waar wij o0.037037, nder door zouden gaan het helder weer de lucht zuiver de koude vinnig onder nul maar omdat de wind gaan liggen scheen mij deze temperatuur niet onverdragelijk
0.076923, "zijn wij aan de pool" vroeg ik met kloppend hart aan den kapitein
0.083346, "als zij maar even schijnen wil het al genoeg" antwoordde de kapitein
0.020408, de nautilus uit vrees van op een klip te stooten blijven liggen op drie kabellengten van een strand waarboven zich prachtige rotsen verhieven de sloep werd zee gebracht de kapitein en twee zijner manschappen die de instrumenten droegen stapten erin koenraad en ik insgelijks het tien uur den morgen 0.055556, ik ned land niet gezien de amerikaan wilde zeker zelfs aan de zuidpool niet erkennen dat hij ongelijk
0.043478, "indien ik niet aarzel" antwoordde hij "dit poolland te betreden het omdat tot nog toe geen menschelijk wezen hier zijn voet heeft gezet"
0.019609, daar kapitein nemo nog niet verschenen gingen koenraad en ik de sloep en roeiden naar wal de aard van den grond nog altijd even vulkanisch overal zagen wij sporen van lava basalt en andere vulkanische uitwerpselen zonder dat wij een krater ontdekten hier vlogen ook weer duizenden vogels om ons heen0.022727,  die dit poolland bevolkten doch zij deelden hun woonplaats met groote troepen zoogdieren die ons met hun zachte oogen aankeken het waren zeekalven van verschillende soorten waarvan sommige op den grond en andere op drijvende ijsschollen lagen terwijl wederom andere zee rondspartelden zij vluchtten0.040000,  niet voor ons daar zij den mensch niet kenden en ik zag er genoeg bij elkaar om eenige honderden schepen mee van leeftocht te voorzien
0.024390, "ik heb den chronometer alleen noodig" antwoordde hij "als morgen om twaalf uur de zonneschijf door den noordelijken horizon juist midden door gedeeld wordt zijn wij aan de zuidpool het spreekt van zelf dat ik de straalbreking daarbij rekening moet brengen"
0.019231, toen kapitein nemo op den top kwam ging hij met den barometer zorgvuldig de hoogte na omdat hij dit bij zijn waarneming rekening moest brengen kwartier voor twaalven scheen de zon die slechts door straalbreking zichtbaar als een gouden schijf en wierp haar stralen op dit eenzaam land en die zee doo0.125001, r den mensch nog nooit met schepen doorkliefd
0.047619, "zeker" antwoordde hij "omdat de waterbakken nog niet ledig zijn als ze dat waren moest de nautilus naar de oppervlakte stijgen"
0.034483, waarlijk ik mijn werk de groote diepten der zee handen ik dit zelf niet gezien ik sloeg het boek dicht en hervatte mijn wandeling ned en koen wilden weggaan
0.500000, geen lucht
0.041667, eenige oogenblikken later zagen wij een twaalftal mannen op het ijs komen ned land door zijn lengte te herkennen de kapitein er ook bij
0.019608, "begrijpt gij niet dat die vorst ons dan te hulp zou komen ziet gij niet dat zij dan die ijsbank die ons ingesloten houdt zou doen vaneenspringen evenals het ijs de hardste steenen doet splijten gevoelt gij niet dat die vorst dan ons reddingsmiddel zijn zou plaats van ons te verdelgen"
0.037037, "ja kapitein misschien maar welke groote kracht de nautilus ook bezit zoo zou hij toch aan die verbazende drukking geen weerstand kunnen bieden en geheel platgedrukt worden"
0.020000, op dat oogenblik wees de manometer aan dat wij nog maar ruim zes meter ijs boven ons hadden een betrekkelijk dunne ijskorst scheidde ons dus van den dampkring af kon die niet doorgebroken worden misschien allen gevalle scheen de nautilus het te zullen beproeven ik gevoelde inderdaad dat het vaartui0.018868, g een schuinen stand aannam dat de achtersteven daalde en de spoor zich naar de hoogte hief er slechts eenig water noodig geweest om deze verplaatsing van het zwaartepunt te weeg te brengen toen begon de krachtige schroef te werken en werd de nautilus als een ram tegen het ijsveld gebruikt het vaar0.031250, tuig deed de ijsbank splijten door stoot op stoot eindelijk barstte zij geheel open en de nautilus sprong met een vreeselijken aanval op de ijsmassa die hij door zijn ontzettend gewicht verbrijzelde
0.111111, "gij behoeft hem daarvoor niet te tarten" antwoordde koenraad
0.076923, "juist mijn vriend" zei ik "het een krampvisch die je zoo toegetakeld heeft"
0.111111, "hoe" vroeg koenraad "inktvisschen van de klasse der koppootigen"
0.052632, "wel waarschijnlijk koen maar ik geloof aan het bestaan van zulke monsters niet voordat ik ze zelf heb gedood"
0.166667, "en dat alles" vroeg de amerikaan
0.020833, het een inktvisch van kolossale afmetingen van acht meter lengte hij zwom de richting van den nautilus met verbazende snelheid achteruit hij staarde ons met zijn groote bleekgroene oogen aan zijn acht voelarmen liever zijn acht pooten die aan den kop vastzaten en waarom deze dieren koppootigen geno0.020408, emd worden waren tweemaal zoo lang als het lichaam en kronkelden als de slangen op het hoofd der men zag duidelijk de tweehonderd zuignappen die aan den binnenkant der voelarmen zaten en er als half bolvormige vliesjes blaasjes uitzagen soms drukte hij die zuignappen tegen het glas en veroorzaakte 0.020408, daardoor een kleine luchtleegte de bek van dit monster zoo hard als hoorn en opende en sloot zich vertikale richting de tong hoornachtig en met eenige rijen tanden gewapend kwam trillend van tusschen deze nijptang te voorschijn welk een speling der natuur een weekdier met een vogelbek het spilvormi0.020000, ge en het midden opgezwollen lichaam vormde een vleezige massa die waarschijnlijk 20 25000 kilogrammen woog de kleur veranderde bijzonder snel naarmate van de woede van het dier en ging van lichtgrijs tot bruinrood waarom werd het dier nijdig zonder twijfel op den nautilus die grooter dan hij en wa0.030303, arop zijn voelarmen en zuignappen geen vat hadden en toch wat zijn de inktvisschen monsterachtig welk eene macht hun bewegingen welk een levenskracht heeft de schepper hun gegeven daar zij drie harten hebben
0.076923, "neen" antwoordde de amerikaan "deze zijn geheel en de ander zijn staart verloren"
0.500000, de golfstroom
0.250000, "vandaag" zei ned land
0.052632, "goed vandaag zal ik hem opzoeken" antwoordde ik daar de amerikaan met zelf te gaan alles zou bedorven hebben
0.020408, "kapitein" antwoordde ik "ik kan de gedachte slechts goedkeuren die u aldus doet handelen de vrucht uwer moet niet verloren gaan maar het middel dat gij daartoe aangrijpt schijnt mij kinderachtig wie weet werwaarts de winden dit kistje zullen heenvoeren en welke handen het zal vallen zoudt gij niet0.090909,  iets beters kunnen uitdenken kunt gij kan een uwer manschappen "
0.083333, "nooit mijnheer" zei de kapitein terwijl hij mij haastig de rede viel
0.024390, "ja mijnheer en het daarover dat ik u kwam spreken sedert zeven maanden zijn wij bij u aan boord en nu vraag ik u heden naam mijner makkers en van mij zelven het uw plan ons altijd bij u te houden"
0.019608, maar de lucht werd hoe langer hoe dreigender er waren voorteekenen van een naderenden orkaan het zwerk werd melkachtig wit plaats van kleine wolkjes rezen aan den gezichteinder dikke zwarte wolken en dreven snel voort de zee begon hol te staan en groote golven te vormen de vogels verdwenen met uitz0.026316, ondering van de stormvogels de barometer daalde sterk en duidde een sterke drukking van den dampkring aan het mengsel het stormglas loste op door den invloed van de electriciteit waarmee de dampkring verzadigd de worsteling der elementen aanstaande
0.100000, "de elf millioen eieren maar ik wilde toch opmerking maken"
0.020408, de nautilus steeg ondertusschen weer langzaam naar de oppervlakte en ik zag de onduidelijke vormen van den vengeur verdwijnen weldra bemerkte ik door een geringe schommeling dat wij aan de oppervlakte waren op dit oogenblik hoorde ik een doffen knal ik keek den kapitein aan deze bewoog zich niet
0.333333, "kapitein" vroeg ik
0.200000, "brave lui" mompelde de amerikaan
0.035714, het geheele vreeselijk verleden kwam mij weer voor den geest plaats van vrienden op het naderend schip te ontmoeten konden wij er alleen vijanden zonder genade op aantreffen
0.025000, "ik zal het wel doen" antwoordde de kapitein koeltjes "krijg het niet uw hoofd om mij te beoordeelen mijnheer het noodlot toont u iets wat gij niet moest zien de aanval begonnen de verdediging zal verschrikkelijk zijn ga naar binnen"
0.043479, "weet gij dat niet des te beter dan zal ten minste de herkomst er van een geheim voor u blijven ga naar beneden"
0.058824, "bovendien" voegde de amerikaan er bij "als ik overvallen word verdedig ik mij en steek mij dood"
