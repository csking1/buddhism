0.019231, ik geloof dat de kapitein wijs gehandeld met dien man voor den tocht aan te werven hij wat de scherpte van zijn blik en de kracht van zijn arm aangaat eene geheele equipage waard ik kan hem nergens beter bij vergelijken dan bij een krachtigen verrekijker die tegelijk voor kanon kan dienen
0.019608, wie van canada spreekt denkt aan frankrijk en hoe weinig ned land zich ook met anderen bemoeide moet ik toch bekennen dat hij eene zekere vriendschap voor mij opvatte mijne afkomst trok hem zeker aan hij daardoor gelegenheid die oude taal van rabelais te spreken welke sommige streken van canada nog0.033333,  gebruik en die ik zoo gaarne hoorde het geslacht van den harpoenier uit quebec afkomstig en telde reeds tal van stoutmoedige visschers den tijd toen deze stad aan frankrijk behoorde

0.500000, "ongeveer 17000"
0.019231, er werd een verzoek dien zin aan den kapitein gericht hij hield zich evenwel goed de matrozen ontveinsden hunne ontevredenheid niet en de dienst leed er onder ik zal niet zeggen dat er een opstand aan boord uitbrak maar nadat de kapitein lang genoeg tegenstand geboden vroeg hij evenals der tijd col0.047619, umbus drie dagen uitstel indien dien tijd het monster niet verschenen zou de abraham lincoln naar den atlantischen oceaan terug keeren
0.038462, maar koenraad kon zijn zin niet voleinden te midden van de algemeene stilte liet zich eene stem hooren het de stem van ned land die schreeuwde
0.333337, met vollen stoom
0.100000, "misschien kan men dit dier evenmin naderen als een sidderaal"
0.018519, het fregat naderde den visch ik beschouwde het beest zoo nauwkeurig mogelijk de rapporten van de shannon en de helvetia hadden de afmetingen wat vergroot en ik hield het er voor dat het beest slechts 250 voet lang moeielijk kon ik nagaan hoe dik het maar het dier scheen mij het algemeen zijne afmet0.200000, ingen goed gevormd te zijn

0.026316, toen hij dit zeide ging de deur open er kwam een hofmeester binnen die kleeren bracht van eene stof vervaardigd welke ik niet kende ik haastte mij om ze aan te trekken en mijne makkers volgden mijn voorbeeld
0.018868, eenige schotels met zilveren deksels werden orde op de tafel gezet en wij namen plaats het zeker dat wij met beschaafde lieden te doen hadden en zonder het electrieke licht waaronder wij zaten zou ik gedacht hebben een aan de table te zitten ik moet echter zeggen dat brood en wijn geheel ontbraken 0.020834, het water frisch en helder maarwater viel 't geheel niet den smaak van ned land onder de opgediende gerechten herkende ik eenige heerlijk klaargemaakte vischsoorten maar eenige overigens lekkere schotels kon ik geen oordeel uitspreken en ik zou zelfs niet hebben kunnen zeggen ze tot het planten die0.033333, renrijk behoorden het servies en tafelzilver waren net en smaakvol elk stuk lepel vork mes bord enz met eene letter geteekend waaromheen een kringetje eenige woorden stonden op deze wijze

0.062500, "mijnheer" hernam ik terwijl ik onwillekeurig driftig werd "gij maakt misbruik van onzen toestand dat wreed"
0.018182, ik wil niet ontkennen dat die woorden van den kapitein grooten indruk op mij maakten ik mijn zwak getast en ik vergat voor een oogenblik dat het zien van al die verheven zaken tegen onze verloren vrijheid toch niet kon opwegen overigens rekende ik op de toekomst om die vraag uit te maken daarom ant0.019608, woordde ik "indien gij met de menschheid hebt gebroken mijnheer wil ik toch wel gelooven dat gij van elk menschelijk gevoel nog geen afstand gedaan hebt wij zullen het niet vergeten dat gij ons arme schipbreukelingen liefderijk aan boord hebt opgenomen ik voor mij wil niet ontveinzen dat als het be0.043479, lang van de wetenschap het verlangen naar vrijheid kon vernietigen al hetgeen gij mij belooft daarvoor ten minste een groote vergoeding zou aanbieden"
0.142857, "dat weiger ik niet" antwoordde de harpoenier
0.020000, ik keek kapitein nemo met groote oogen aan en antwoordde "ik begrijp volkomen mijnheer dat uwe netten u voortreffelijken visch bezorgen ik begrijp minder goed dat gij het waterwild uwe onderzeesche bosschen vervolgt maar ik begrijp het geheel niet dat een enkel stukje vleesch hoe klein dan ook op u0.333333, we tafel komt"

0.055556, "thans moet ik u een en ander verklaren mijnheer de professor" zeide kapitein nemo "hoor mij dus aan"
0.043478, "wij hebben nog niet gedaan mijnheer aronnax" zeide kapitein nemo terwijl hij opstond "als gij mij wilt volgen zullen wij den achtersteven bezoeken"
0.052632, zonder twijfel een uitmuntend licht vaartuigje dat niet zinken kan en voor uitstapjes en voor de vischvangst gebruikt wordt"
0.018868, na het trapgat voorbijgegaan te zijn waardoor men op het plat kon komen zag ik eene hut van twee meter lengte waar koenraad en ned land verrukt het aangeboden maal bezig waren dit te verorberen daarna opende de kapitein eene deur welke eene drie meter lange keuken uitkwam deze tusschen de groote ko0.500000, mbuizen gelegen
0.333333, "middag" zeide hij
0.041667, "van welken meridiaan" vroeg ik driftig hopende dat het antwoord van den kapitein mij misschien zou doen gewaar worden uit welk land hij afkomstig
0.023256, toen ned dit zeide werd het eensklaps donker als de nacht het licht aan de zoldering verdween en wel zoo snel dat mijne oogen er pijnlijk door werden aangedaan evenals dit geschiedt wanneer men van de diepste duisternis plotseling het schitterendste licht komt
0.027778, ik ging aan het bestudeeren van alle schatten welke onder de glazen ramen lagen opgestapeld ik doorbladerde de groote herbariums die opgevuld waren met de zeldzaamste zeeplanten welke hoewel gedroogd toch hare schoone kleuren hadden behouden
0.333331, "16 november 1867
0.200000, "met het geweer de hand"
0.043478, "juist kapitein maar de medegevoerde lucht moet dunkt mij spoedig verbruikt zijn en zoodra zij nog maar 15 pct zuurstof bevat zij bedorven"
0.043478, "bovendien" zeide ik "gij zoudt een ontzaglijken weerstand moeten overwinnen om te schieten de vloeistof welke 855 maal dichter dan de lucht is"
0.071429, "dit het bosch van het eiland crespo" dacht ik en ik bedroog mij niet
0.333333, een onderzeesch woud
0.018519, bij die gelegenheid ik getuige van een der schoonste schoten welke ooit een jagershart hebben doen kloppen een groote vogel met breede vlucht dreef voor den wind op ons af de makker van den kapitein legde aan en schoot toen de vogel nog op eenige meter boven de oppervlakte het dier viel getroffen n0.019608, eder dicht bij den behendigen schutter die zich van zijn buit meester maakte het een albatros van de schoonste soort onze tocht door dit voorval niet opgehouden gedurende twee uur gingen wij zandvlakten weiden van zeegras waar het loopen moeielijk viel om de waarheid te zeggen ik kon niet meer toen0.019608,  ik op een halven kilometer afstand een flauw licht de duisternis zag schemeren het de lantaarn van de nautilus binnen twintig minuten moesten wij aan boord zijn en daar zou ik weder vrij kunnen ademhalen want het scheen mij toe dat mijn toestel mij slechts zeer weinig zuurstofhoudende lucht meer t0.071429, oevoerde ik rekende evenwel buiten eene ontmoeting welke onze komst aan boord eenigermate vertraagde
0.076924, "ik weet ten minste" zeide ik "wat de voornaamste peilingen ons geleerd hebben"
0.022222, op 15 december lieten wij den schoonen archipel der gezelschapseilanden en het bevallige taiti de koningin der stille zuidzee oostwaarts liggen 's morgens bemerkte ik eenige kilometer onder den wind de hooge bergtoppen van die eilanden deze streken vingen wij voortreffelijke visch voor onze tafel
0.018519, het een oude bekende op den grooten oceaan de kapitein dillon die het eerst de stelligste sporen van de schipbreuk vond den 15den mei 1824 kwam hij met zijn schip de saint patrick voorbij het eilandje tikopia een van de nieuwe hebriden daar kwam een inlander zijne kano bij hem aan boord en verkocht0.022222,  hem een zilveren degengevest waarin letters gegraveerd stonden die inlander beweerde overigens dat hij zes jaar geleden bij eene reis naar vanikoro daar twee europeanen gezien die behoorden tot de bemanning van schepen welke lang te voren op de klippen van het eiland vergaan waren
0.020833, de fransche regeering bang dat d'urville niet op de hoogte van hetgeen dillon reeds gedaan zond de korvet de bayonnaise onder kapitein legorant de tromelin naar vanikoro welk schip op dat oogenblik ergens op de westkust van amerika gestationneerd de bayonnaise liet eenige maanden na het vertrek van0.043478,  de astrolabe het anker voor vanikoro vallen doch vond niets nieuws alleen bevond men dat de inboorlingen het gedenkteeken voor la hadden ontzien
0.021739, "kapitein la vertrok 7 december 1785 met zijne schepen eerst ankerde hij de botanybaai daarop bezocht hij de vriendschapseilanden richtte toen den steven naar santacruz en wierp het anker voor namouka een der vriendschapseilanden toen kwamen de schepen op de onbekende klippen van vanikoro de bousso0.019608, le zeilde vooruit en stootte aan den zuidkant van het eiland de astrolabe kwam te hulp doch leed eveneens schipbreuk het eerste schip werd bijna onmiddellijk uit elkander geslagen het tweede dat onder den wind op het zand geraakt hield het nog eenige dagen uit de schipbreukelingen werden door de in0.020000, landers vrij goed ontvangen zij zetten zich op het eiland neder en bouwden daar een kleiner schip met de overblijfselen van het groote eenige matrozen bleven vrijwillig op vanikoro de anderen hoewel zwak en ziek vertrokken met la zij zetten koers naar de salomoneilanden en vergingen met man en muis0.111111,  op de westkust van het voornaamste eiland dier groep"
0.018868, "ik weet niet wat ik mijnheer moet antwoorden" zeide koenraad "zeker het dat wij vreemde dingen zien en dat wij die twee maanden geen tijd hebben gehad om ons te vervelen het laatste wat wij zien altijd nog het meest verbazingwekkende en als dat zoo doorgaat weet ik niet waarmede het eindigen moet 0.100000, ik geloof dat wij zulk eene gelegenheid nooit weder krijgen"
0.020000, "ned land denkt juist het tegenovergestelde als ik" antwoordde koenraad "hij veel te veel aan het stoffelijke gehecht en maakt een afgod van zijn maag visschen bekijken en altijd visschen eten voor hem niet genoeg dat hij wijn brood en vleesch moet missen bevalt niemendal aan onzen amerikaan die ge0.071429, woon biefstuk te eten en niet bang voor brandewijn jenever hoewel altijd met mate"
0.034483, "ik dank u koen doch gij moet uw nieuwjaarsfooi tot later uitstellen en u daarvoor nu maar tevreden stellen met een hartelijken handdruk ik heb niets anders te geven"
0.021277, onze toestand inderdaad gevaarlijk maar de nautilus scheen als door eene betoovering midden tusschen deze vreeselijke klippen door te komen zij volgde niet juist den weg van de astrolabe welke voor dumont d'urville zoo noodlottig het vaartuig nam den koers meer noordelijk voer langs het eiland murr0.019608, ay en richtte zich toen zuidwestwaarts naar de doorvaart van cumberland ik dacht dat het schip er recht doorheen zou gaan toen het zich weder noordwestwaarts wendde en tusschen een groot aantal weinig bekende eilandjes en rotsen door naar het eiland tound en het slechte kanaal voer ik vroeg mij zel0.026316, ven af kapitein nemo onvoorzichtig en zijn schip dezen doorgang wilde wagen waar de twee korvetten van d'urville op de rotsen stootten toen hij voor de tweede maal van richting veranderde en westwaarts naar het eiland gueboroar liep
0.025641, ned land kende die vruchten wel hij er bij zijne talrijke reizen meermalen van gegeten en hij wist ze goed open te krijgen toen hij ze zag werd zijne begeerte aanstonds opgewekt en hij kon zich niet langer bedwingen
0.500000, "neen ned"
0.090909, "ik zie dus ned dat er niets aan dit brood ontbreekt"
0.125002, "ten minste twee uur" gaf koenraad ten antwoord
0.062500, "als mijnheer hem eens goed bekijken wil zal hij zien dat er zooveel verdienste niet steekt"
0.333333, "en waarom koen"
0.022222, "zeer zeldzaam wakkere vriend en vooral hoogst moeielijk om ze levend te vangen zelfs als zij dood zijn worden deze vogels nog als een belangrijk handelsartikel beschouwd daarom hebben de inboorlingen een middel verzonnen om ze na te maken zooals men paarlen en diamanten namaakt"
0.033333, "mooi zoo" riep ned land "al het dan de vogel niet dan zijn het toch zijne vederen en zoolang het beest niet gegeten wordt zie ik er geen kwaad in"
0.166667, "bijna" antwoordde koenraad "het zijn wilden"
0.045455, "ja kapitein" zeide ik "maar wij hebben ongelukkig een troep tweevoetige wezens achter ons aan gekregen wier nabijheid ons vrij verontrustend toeschijnt"
0.052632, "welnu" antwoordde ik "als gij ze niet bij u aan boord wilt hebben dient gij eenige voorzorgsmaatregelen te nemen"
0.090910, "een linksche schelp" herhaalde koenraad met een van vreugde kloppend hart
0.040000, "morgen" voegde de kapitein er bij terwijl hij opstond "morgen middag twintig minuten voor zal de nautilus vlot worden en zonder schade de torrestraat verlaten"
0.024390, de nautilus ontvlood dus de drukst bevaren van europa niet en ik maakte daaruit op dat hij ons misschien binnen kort naar beschaafde streken zou voeren ik dacht wel dat ned land die bijzonderheid zeer natuurlijk met groote vreugde zou hooren
0.023256, den 16den januari scheen de nautilus op eenige meters diepte als ingeslapen de electrieke toestellen waren werkeloos en het vaartuig werd slechts door den zeestroom voortgestuwd terwijl de schroef onbeweeglijk bleef ik veronderstelde dat de equipage bezig het inwendige eenige herstellingen te verri0.071429, chten welke noodig waren geworden wegens de bijzonder snelle beweging van de laatste dagen
0.142857, "kijk eens het ontbijt staat op tafel"
0.052632, "zeg eens vriend ned" merkte koenraad op "wat zoudt ge wel gezegd hebben als er het geheel niets stond"
0.200000, "zijt gij geneesheer mijnheer aronnax"
0.142857, "hebt gij dan een zieke aan boord"
0.018868, nadat dit afgeloopen richtten de kapitein en zijne makkers zich op toen naderden zij nogmaals het graf bogen nog eenmaal de knie en staken de hand als tot een laatste vaarwel uit daarop nam de treurige stoet den terugtocht naar de nautilus aan ging nogmaals onder het woudgewelf te midden van de hee0.037037, sters en koraalstruiken door en steeg weder naar boven eindelijk zagen wij het scheepslicht dat ons naar de nautilus ten gids strekte om uur waren wij terug
0.083333, "dat ons vreedzaam kerkhof eenige honderden voeten onder het vlak der zee"
0.020000, ik meende evenwel andere reden voor zijn gedrag en zijn karakter te vinden het geheimzinnige van den laatsten nacht toen wij onze gevangenis door slaap overmand lagen zijn zoo driftig genomen voorzorg om mij den kijker voor het oog weg te rukken omdat ik den gezichteinder wilde onderzoeken de doode0.022727, lijke wond van dien matroos door een onverklaarbaren schok van den nautilus veroorzaakt neen kapitein nemo ontvluchtte niet alleen de menschen zijn vreeselijk vaartuig diende niet alleen om hem geheel onafhankelijk te maken maar misschien ook omik weet niet welkeverschrikkelijke wraak uit te oefene0.030303, op dit oogenblik mij alles nog niet recht duidelijk ik zie deze duisternis maar enkele flikkeringen en ik moet mij tevreden stellen met het opschrijven mijner denkbeelden onder den indruk der verschillende gebeurtenissen
0.052632, weldra verdween het eiland aan den gezichteinder en het vaartuig richtte zich naar het noordwesten naar het indische schiereiland
0.052632, "dan doet hij net als kapitein nemo" antwoordde koenraad "daarom zou hij zijn vaartuig liever 'argonaut' hebben moeten noemen"
0.076923, de hemel hoewel vol heldere sterren scheen zwart vergelijking van het stille water
0.045458, "maar kan mijnheer mij zeggen" vroeg koenraad "waardoor dit verschijnsel ontstaat want ik veronderstel toch dat het water niet melk veranderd is"
0.111111, "derhalve altijd nog die oude manier zwang" vroeg ik
0.083334, "ik zonder twijfel ik zie dat gij er veel lust hebt ned"
0.020833, "de parel" antwoordde ik "is voor den dichter een traan der zee voor de oosterlingen een hard geworden dauwdruppel voor de vrouwen een kostbaarheid van langwerpigen vorm met glasachtig uiterlijk en van een parelmoerachtige stof welke zij aan vingers hals ooren dragen voor een scheikundige ze een ve0.032258, rbinding van phosphorzure en koolzure kalk met een weinig gelatine en eindelijk voor de natuuronderzoekers een eenvoudige ziekelijke afscheiding van het orgaan dat bij zekere schelpdieren het parelmoer doet geboren worden"
0.018868, "men doet dit op verschillende wijzen en dikwijls trekken de visschers ze met tangen uit de schelp als de parels er aan vast zitten gewoonlijk echter worden de oesters uitgespreid op matten van spaansch riet die men op het strand heeft uitgelegd zoo sterven zij de lucht en na een tiental dagen zijn0.019231,  zij vrij ver gevorderden staat van ontbinding gekomen dan werpt men ze groote bakken met zeewater waarin men ze opent en wascht dan begint het dubbele werk der schilders eerst splijten zij de platten parelmoer uit de schelp welke kisten van 125 tot 150 kilo verzonden worden dan nemen zij het diert0.055556, je uit den oester koken dat en ziften het om er zelfs de kleinste parels uit te halen"
0.038462, "het spijt mij dat ik die dame niet tot vrouw heb" sprak de amerikaan terwijl hij zijn arm op weinig dubbelzinnige wijze heen en weer bewoog
0.032258, "zooals gij zegt ned maar" voegde ik er bij terwijl ik trachtte om op denzelfden vroolijken toon te spreken als kapitein nemo "zeg eens dappere ned ben je bang voor haaien"
0.021277, om zes uur werd het eensklaps dag met een snelheid die aan deze keerkringsstreken eigen waar men geen morgen avondschemering kent de zonnestralen drongen door het wolkengordijn dat het oosten zichtbaar en het schitterend hemellichaam verhief zich snel het luchtruim ik zag duidelijk het land met hie0.200000, r en daar enkele boomen
0.020833, "wij zijn er mijnheer aronnax" zei toen de kapitein "gij ziet deze enge baai hier zullen een maand de talrijke visschersbooten der pachters bijeenkomen en de duikers den bodem stoutmoedig onderzoeken deze baai voor dit soort van visschen allergunstigst zij tegen de sterkste winden beschut en de zee0.050000,  er nooit sterke deining wat voor de duikers zeer gelukkig wij zullen nu onze scaphanders aandoen en onze wandeling beginnen"
0.019608, het langzamerhand hooger klimmen der zon verlichtte het water hoe langer zoo meer op het fijne zand van den bodem volgde een weg als het ware met ronde rotssteenen geplaveid die met weekdieren en als met een tapijt bedekt waren ik herkende daaronder verscheidene mij reeds bekende soorten en onder a0.019231, nderen ook een afschuwelijk dier namelijk een groote krab door darwin reeds beschreven en waaraan de natuur het instinct en de noodige kracht heeft gegeven om zich met kokosnooten te voeden het dier klimt op den oever de boomen laat de noten vallen opdat zij daardoor zouden barsten en opent ze dan 0.040000, met zijne sterke scharen onder de heldere golven liep de krab met een onvergelijkelijke snelheid terwijl kleine zeeschildpadden zich slechts langzaam tusschen de rotssteenen voortbewogen
0.019608, ik naderde dit bewonderenswaardig weekdier met zijn weefsel zat het op een granietrots vast en daar groeide het geheel alleen het kalme water der grot ik schatte het gewicht van die oester op driehonderd kilo zulk een dier heeft vijftien kilo vleesch en men zou de maag van een gargantua diergelijke0.076923, n reus moeten hebben om er een paar dozijn van op te eten
0.020408, wij liepen elk afzonderlijk als ware slenteraars daar ieder staan bleef vooruitging naarmate hij het zijn hoofd kreeg wat mij aanging ik koesterde geen vrees meer voor de gevaren die mijn verbeelding zoo bespottelijk overdreven de bodem naderde merkbaar het vlak der zee en weldra stonden wij zulk o0.018868, ndiep water dat mijn hoofd er boven uitstak koenraad kwam naar mij toe en zijn helm tegen den mijnen aandrukkende groette hij mij vriendelijk met zijn oogen deze hoogte echter maar enkele vademen breed en weldra waren wij weer geheel "ons element" verdwenen ik geloof wel dat ik het nu zoo noemen ma0.018869, "ik zal u wel niet behoeven te zeggen mijnheer" antwoordde ned land "dat de roode zee even goed afgesloten als de perzische golf omdat het kanaal van suez nog niet doorgegraven en al ware dit het geval dan zou dit geheimzinnig vaartuig zich toch niet dat door sluizen afgesloten water wagen de roode0.083333,  zee dus ook de weg niet langs welken wij europa zullen bereiken"
0.025000, gedurende vier dagen dus tot 3 februari doorkliefde de nautilus de zee van oman met verschillende snelheid en op onderscheiden diepte het vaartuig ging onzeker voorwaarts alsof men aarzelde welken weg te kiezen maar het kwam nimmer den kreeftskeerkring uit
0.020833, den 8sten februari kregen wij bij het aanbreken van den dag mekka het gezicht de stad ligt thans puin de muren zouden bij een enkel kanonschot instorten en worden ter nauwernood door eenige dadelboomen beschaduwd het eertijds een belangrijke stad met zes openbare marktpleinen zevenentwintig en de m0.076923, uren die door veertien forten beschermd werden hadden een omtrek van drie kilometer
0.020000, de spons geen plantaardig voorwerp zooals nog door sommige natuuronderzoekers beweerd wordt maar een dier dat echter op den allerlaagsten trap van dierlijk leven en nog beneden de koralen staat dat het een dier lijdt geen twijfel zelfs moet men zich losmaken van de meening der ouden die de sponsen 0.022222, beschouwden als plantdieren voorwerpen tusschen de planten en de dierenwereld staande ik moet echter aanmerken dat de natuuronderzoekers het niet eens zijn de plaats die aan de sponsen moet worden toegekend sommigen rekenen ze tot de poliepen anderen waaronder milne edwards willen ze geheel afzonde0.333333, rlijk geplaatst hebben
0.040000, ik riep dus koenraad bij mij terwijl de nautilus ter diepte van acht tot negen meter zachtjes langs de fraaie rotsen der oostelijke kust gleed
0.058824, "men ziet het wel" antwoordde ik "dat de geschiedschrijvers niet aan boord van den nautilus geweest zijn"
0.022222, dienzelfden dag deelde ik aan koenraad en ned land het gedeelte van het gesprek mede dat hun belang kon inboezemen toen ik hun vertelde dat wij binnen twee dagen de middellandsche zee zouden zijn klapte koenraad de handen maar de amerikaan trok de schouders op
0.031250, "wij zullen wel eens zien" antwoordde ned land het hoofd schuddende "maar ik zou niets liever dan aan dien doortocht gelooven de hemel geve dat hij ons inderdaad de middellandsche zee brenge"
0.022727, den volgenden dag 10 februari verschenen verschillende schepen die eene andere richting als wij volgden de nautilus zette haar tocht onder zee door doch toen om twaalf uur op het oogenblik dat de zonshoogte moest genomen worden de zee verlaten kwamen wij weer boven
0.076923, "neen" antwoordde ned "maar als ik mij niet sterk vergis het een zeedier"
0.032258, "o het beweegt zich het duikt" riep ned land uit "duizend duivels wat dat voor een dier het heeft geen gespleten staart zooals walvisschen potvisschen en de zwemvliezen lijken op stompen"
0.040000, "neen" zei ik tot koenraad "het geen sirene maar een zonderling beest waarvan er ternauwernood eenige exemplaren de roode zee zijn overgebleven het een dugong"
0.030303, de kapitein bracht mij naar de middeltrap halverwege opende hij een deur volgde een bovengang en kwam den stuurstoel die zooals men weet aan het einde van het plat boven het vaartuig lag
0.050000, "dat er zich omstandigheden zullen voordoen waarvan wij kunnen en moeten gebruik maken en dat evengoed zes maanden als thans"
0.062500, "'t zou wat" zei ned land "en waar zullen wij zes maanden zijn mijnheer de natuuronderzoeker"
0.020000, "vriend koen" antwoordde deze bedaard "heeft niets te zeggen evenals zijn meester en zijn vriend ned hij ongehuwd vrouw kinderen en bloedverwanten wachten zijn vaderland niet op hem hij dienst van mijnheer hij denkt als mijnheer hij spreekt als mijnheer en tot zijn spijt behoeft men op hem niet te 0.024390, rekenen om een meerderheid te verkrijgen er zijn dus maar twee personen mijnheer aan den eenen en ned land aan den anderen kant nu hij dit gezegd heeft luistert vriend koen weer toe en gereed de aanteekeningen er bij te maken"
0.090909, "en wil je nu weten ned wat ik je plan denk"
0.052632, ik wilde den salon verlaten toen kapitein nemo binnentrad hij ging naar den thermometer keek dien na en zei
0.166667, "ik geloof het graag" zei koenraad
0.050000, "en" vroeg koenraad "als eenige vulkanische uitbarsting die beide scheidingsmuren eens tot boven de golven verhief" "dat niet waarschijnlijk koenraad"
0.333333, "maar de zon"
0.018868, "komaan" zei ik "niets nog verloren wij varen de kust van portugal langs frankrijk en engeland zijn niet ver meer verwijderd en daar kunnen wij immers ook heen vluchten als de nautilus buiten de straat van gibralter komende zich naar het zuiden gewend als hij ons mee gesleept naar de streken waar b0.025642, ijna geen land te vinden dan zou ik even teleurgesteld zijn als jij maar nu weten wij dat kapitein nemo de der beschaafde niet ontvlucht en binnen weinige dagen geloof ik wel dat je met volle zekerheid kunt handelen"
0.019608, ik bleef mijn kamer omdat ik den kapitein wilde ontwijken die mijn oog en op mijn gelaat de ontroering niet mocht lezen die zich van mij meester gemaakt ik bracht dus een treurigen dag door geslingerd tusschen de begeerte om mijne vrijheid terug te krijgen en het leedwezen dezen wonderbaarlijken na0.020000, utilus te verlaten zonder mijn onderzeesche voleindigd te hebben ik zou dus dien oceaan vaarwelzeggen zonder er de diepten van te hebben nagespoord zonder ook hier de geheimen te hebben ontdekt welke de indische en groote oceaan mij hadden ontvouwd mijn roman viel mij reeds bij het eerste deel uit 0.021739, de handen mijn droom werd op het schoonste oogenblik afgebroken welke onaangename uren gingen er voorbij dan zag ik mij met mijn makkers aan wal dan weer wenschte ik tegen het gezond verstand dat eenige onvoorziene omstandigheden het plan van ned land duigen mochten doen vallen
0.018868, toen vroeg ik mij zelven af die vreemde man wel aan boord sedert dien nacht waarin de sloep den nautilus verlaten om die geheimzinnige reis te doen waren mijn denkbeelden te zijnen opzichte wel eenigszins gewijzigd ik dacht dat kapitein nemo wat hij ook mocht zeggen met het bewoonde land nog wel ee0.019231, nige betrekking zou staan verliet hij nooit den nautilus weken waren soms voorbij gegaan dat ik hem niet gezien wat deed hij dien tijd en bedreef hij geen daden waarvan ik den aard niet kon gissen terwijl ik nog altijd meende dat hij een eeuwigen haat aan het menschdom gezworen duizenden gedachten 0.024390, van dien aard bestormden mij het veld mijner veronderstellingen moest zich uitbreiden de omstandigheden waarin ik mij bevond ik voelde mij zeer onaangenaam ik dacht dat aan den dag geen einde zou komen de uren sloegen te langzaam voor mijn ongeduld
0.019231, ik wilde den salon een laatste maal weerzien ik ging door de gang en kwam het museum waar ik zoo vele aangename en nuttige uren doorgebracht ik bekeek al die rijkdommen al die schatten als iemand die den volgenden dag levenslange ballingschap wordt weggevoerd die vertrekt om niet weer terug te kome0.018868, n die wonderen der natuur die meesterstukken der kunst tusschen welke ik reeds zoovele dagen mijns levens sleet zou ik voor altijd verlaten ik zou nog eens door de glazen van den salon het water van den oceaan hebben willen zien maar de wanden bleven vast gesloten en een ijzeren plaat scheidde mij 0.125000, van de zee die ik nog niet kende
0.040000, "welnu mijnheer aronnax" het antwoord "wij zijn die baai van vigo en het hangt maar van u af om er de geheimen van te doorgronden"
0.038462, "ik begrijp het kapitein vergun mij evenwel de opmerking dat nu gij de baai van vigo op deze wijze onderzoekt gij de werkzaamheden eener maatschappij voorkomt"
0.250000, "welnu mijnheer" zei hij
0.500000, "heel graag"
0.019608, maar welk gedeelte van den aardbol het toch dat door overstroomingen scheen verzwolgen te zijn wie deze rotsen en steenen daar neergezet als gedenkteekenen van voorhistorische tijden waar ik en waar een luim van den kapitein mij heengebracht ik het hem wel willen vragen maar omdat ik het niet kon d0.033333, oen bleef ik staan en greep hem bij den arm hij schudde met het hoofd en wees mij den laatsten bergtop alsof hij wilde zeggen "kom maar mee kom maar"
0.020000, wij bleven een uur lang op deze plaats en beschouwden onder den lichtenden schijn van de gloeiende en soms verbazend schitterende lava de uitgestrekte vlakte het koken en woelen onder den grond deed den berg van tijd tot tijd dreunen en trillen zware geluiden werden met de grootste nauwkeurigheid d0.020834, oor het water overgebracht en weerkaatsten met statige kracht op dat oogenblik scheen de maan een poos door het water heen en wierp het verzwolgen landschap eenige bleeke stralen het maar een oogenblik doch van een onbeschrijfelijke uitwerking de kapitein richtte zich op wierp een laatsten blik op 0.017857, de onmetelijke vlakte en wenkte mij toen hem te volgen wij daalden den berg spoedig af toen wij het woud door waren zag ik de lantaarn van den nautilus schitteren als een ster de kapitein ging er recht op af en wij waren weer aan boord toen de eerste stralen van het morgenlicht schenen de oppervlak0.250000, te van den oceaan
0.200000, "maar dat begrijp ik niet"
0.052632, "zou het u aangenaam zijn" vroeg de kapitein "er iets meer van mee te nemen dan alleen de herinnering"
0.035714, "wij gaan weer naar boven mijnheer de professor wij mogen niet te lang dezen toestand blijven en den nautilus niet al te zeer blootstellen aan zulk een drukking"
0.100000, "goed laat ons dan weer naar boven gaan antwoordde ik
0.020000, "door berekening mijnheer kent den inhoud van den nautilus en dus ook de hoeveelheid daarin vervatte lucht als mijnheer nu ook weet hoeveel lucht elk mensch voor de ademhaling noodig heeft en dit vergelijkt met de noodzakelijkheid waarin de nautilus verkeert om elke vier en twintig uur eens boven t0.500000, e komen"
0.038462, " geeft 625 dat dus te zeggen dat de lucht die de nautilus bevat juist genoeg zou zijn voor 625 menschen gedurende vier en twintig uur"
0.111111, "ik moet je dus alleen geduld aanraden vriend ned"
0.047619, "kan een walvischvaarder zijn oud ambacht ooit vergeten mijnheer krijgt men wel ooit genoeg van het genot van zulk een jacht"
0.142857, "hebje deze streken nog nooit gevischt ned"
0.037040, "dat komt mij overdreven voor" antwoordde ik "bij de aleuten een soort van walvisschen met rugvinnen die even als de potvisschen kleiner zijn dan de gewone walvisch"
0.052632, "maar wat gij zeker niet weet mijnheer aronnax dat de walvisschen bij de schepping der wereld veel sneller zwommen"
0.062500, "maar vriend ned waarom vraag je den kapitein geen vergunning om er jacht op te maken"
0.071429, "recht door zee" antwoordde koenraad "als hij niet verder kan zal hij wel ophouden"
0.037037, "wij kunnen zelfs op veel grooter diepte die gelijkmatige temperatuur van het zeewater opzoeken en daar tarten wij ongestraft de dertig veertig graad koude van de oppervlakte"
0.017241, kapitein nemo sprak de waarheid ik zoover gekomen dat ik nog stoutmoediger werd dan hij ik sleepte hem mee naar de pool ik liep hem reeds vooruit en dat nog wel zeer verre maar neen onnoozele dwaas kapitein nemo kende beter dan ik het voor en tegen deze zaak en hij schepte er vermaak om mij door he0.250000, rsenschimmen vervoering te zien
0.020000, op omstreeks drie honderd meter diepte dreven wij zooals kapitein nemo voorspeld onder het gegolfde ondervlak der ijsbank maar de nautilus zonk nog dieper wij bereikten een laagte van acht honderd meter de temperatuur van het water die aan het oppervlak bedroeg nu niet meer dan wij hadden dus reeds0.038462,  gewonnen het spreekt van zelf dat de temperatuur den nautilus door verwarmingstoestellen vrij wat hooger liep het vaartuig gehoorzaamde aan alle bewegingen met de grootste nauwkeurigheid
0.019231, onder de open zee de nautilus regelrecht koers naar de zuidpool gezet zonder van den twee en vijftigsten lengtegraad af te wijken van 30' tot bleven er ons nog 30' te doorloopen dat nog ongeveer 2500 kilometer de nautilus een gemiddelde snelheid van 60 kilometer het uur dus ongeveer van een sneltre0.066667, in indien wij deze snelheid behielden waren veertig uur voldoende om de pool te bereiken
0.020408, ik snelde naar het plat het zoo wij waren open zee er waren maar enkele schotsen drijvende ijsbergen zichtbaar zoover het oog reikte zag ik niets dan zee de lucht fladderden duizenden vogels millioenen visschen zwommen het water dat naarmate van de diepte donker blauw olijfgroen de honderdgradige t0.045455, hermometer wees drie boven nul het achter de ijsbank waarvan de massa zich aan den noordelijken gezichteinder uitstrekte als het ware lente
0.500000, "waarom koen"
0.041667, "mijnheer weet wel" antwoordde koenraad "dat ik niet zeer sterk ben de practijk maar als mijnheer mij de namen van die beesten genoemd heeft"
0.500000, "vechten zij"
0.020000, het treurig nogmaals konden er geen waarnemingen geschieden als dit den volgenden dag niet gebeurde moesten wij de zaak bepaald opgeven want wij hadden juist den 20sten maart den volgenden dag het dag en nachtevening en zou de zon voor zes maanden onder den gezichteinder verdwijnen dan begon de lan0.028571, ge poolnacht sedert 21 september zij aan den noordelijken gezichteinder verdwenen zich een spiraalvormige loopbaan verheven tot 21 december en toen weer gaan dalen om den volgenden dag haar laatste stralen het poolland te werpen
0.071429, den volgenden morgen 21 maart ik op het plat en vond er kapitein nemo
0.018182, op dat oogenblik legde de kapitein de hand op mijn schouder en zei "in 1600 bereikten de hollanders door een zeestroom meegesleept den 64sten graad de beroemde cook drong door tot 30' en 1774 zelfs tot 15' de engelschman weddel kwam tot 15' en james ross bereikte 1842 met de erebus en terror 4' wel0.034483, nu ik kapitein nemo heb op 21 maart 1868 de zuidpool op bereikt en ik neem bezit van dit gedeelte van den aardbol dat als zesde werelddeel gelden kan"
0.020000, ik dacht onzen toestand na de kapitein keek enkel naar den manometer de nautilus nu ongeveer vijftig meter gerezen maar hij lag nog altijd op zijde plotseling voelden wij een lichte beweging het vaartuig het richtte zich dus een weinig op laagzamerhand namen de schilderijen den salon den vorigen st0.028571, and weer en stonden de wanden weer bijna loodrecht niemand van ons sprak een woord met kloppend hart voelden wij ons oprichten de vloer lag weer horizontaal onder onze voeten tien minuten gingen zoo voorbij
0.200000, "wat dat schoon" riep koenraad
0.019608, tegen den avond de groeve nog een meter dieper gemaakt toen ik weer aan boord kwam stikte ik bijna door het koolzuur waarmee de atmosfeer daar binnen verzadigd waarom hadden wij geen scheikundige middelen om dit gas te verdrijven aan zuurstof hadden wij geen gebrek het water bevatte een groote hoev0.019608, eelheid en als wij dit door onzen toestand wisten te ontbinden zou het ons door de zuurstof nieuwe levenskracht hebben geschonken ik dacht er wel aan doch waartoe zou het gediend hebben daar het koolzuur alle deelen van ons vaartuig doorgedrongen om het koolzuur weg te nemen hadden wij groote vazen0.062500,  met bijtende potasch moeten vullen en die aanhoudend schudden en juist deze stof ontbrak aan boord
0.200000, "ik zal het doen mijnheer"
0.028571, gedurende den nacht steeg de temperatuur tot graad onder nul hooger konden wij niet komen maar daar het zeewater eerst bij een koude van twee graden bevriest ik eindelijk verzekerd dat wij niet konden invriezen
0.043479, plotseling zonk de nautilus door zijn ontzaglijke zwaarte als een kogel het water het alsof het vaartuig een leege ruimte naar beneden viel
0.041667, deze streken werden schoone visschen gevangen eenden en ganzen vielen bij dozijnen op het plat neer zij werden gemakkelijk gevangen en de kombuis gebracht
0.020409, tegen elf uur des morgens gingen wij onder den steenbokskeerkring door op ongeveer wl en stevenden om kaap frio tot groote spijt van ned land scheen de kapitein de bewoonde kuststreek van te willen ontvlieden want de nautilus stoof met duizelingwekkende snelheid vooruit geen visch geen vogel hoe sn0.020408, el ook kon ons volgen en alle natuurlijke bijzonderheden dezer ontsnapten aan ons oog deze snelheid werd gedurende verscheidene dagen volgehouden en den avond van 9 april verkenden wij reeds kaap roque de oostelijke punt van zuidamerika doch toen week de nautilus opnieuw af en zocht een grootere di0.018868, epte te bereiken de vallei tusschen deze kaap en sierra leone afrika op de hoogten der antillen verdeelt deze vallei zich en eindigt aan de noordzijde een verbazende diepte van 9000 meter op deze plaats ligt op de hoogte der kleine antillen een klip van zes kilometer lengte terwijl er bij de kaapve0.024390, rdische eilanden een andere rotswand van geen mindere grootte wordt aangetroffen die aldus het geheele verzonken atlantis insluit beneden deze uitgestrekte vallei liggen eenige berghoogten welke de onderzeesche streken schoone gezichten opleveren ik kan daarover spreken na inzage van de geteekende 0.047619, kaarten die de boekerij van den nautilus te vinden waren en zeker door kapitein nemo zelven volgens persoonlijke waarneming waren opgemaakt
0.037037, ned land en ik hielpen hem op de wreven hem zoo hard als wij konden en toen hij weer bij zijn zinnen gekomen mompelde die eeuwige klassenindeeler
0.019231, "en weet gij" voegde ik er bij "wat er gebeurd nu de mensch die nuttige dieren bijna geheel heeft uitgeroeid het rottende gras heeft de lucht verpest en de vergiftigde lucht heeft de gele koorts doen ontstaan die deze prachtige streken soms zoo deerlijk teistert deze warme streken heeft zich het ve0.019231, rgif uitgebreid en de kwaal nu verbreid van de monding van den rio de la plata tot aan florida en als wij toussenel moeten gelooven die ramp nog niets vergelijking van hetgeen onze nakomelingen zullen ondervinden wanneer er geen walvisschen en walrussen meer te vinden zijn dan zal de zee vol weekdi0.025000, eren inktvisschen en ander tuig van dat soort zijn zoodat zij dan een middelpunt van besmetting zal worden omdat men er dan 'de groote magen' niet meer aantreft aan welke de voorzienigheid de taak opgedragen om de zee te zuiveren"
0.071429, "waarom niet" antwoordde koen "wij hebben wel aan den eenhoorn van mijnheer geloof geslagen"
0.250000, "met je eigen oogen"
0.100000, "maar wat nu van al die verhalen waar" vroeg koenraad
0.018519, de nautilus dreef zonder twijfel maar ging niet meer vooruit de schroef draaide niet meer een minuut ging voorbij kapitein nemo kwam met zijn stuurman binnen ik hem sinds eenigen tijd niet meer gezien hij zag er somber uit zonder tot ons te spreken misschien zelfs zonder ons te zien ging hij naar h0.038462, et raam bekeek de inktvisschen en zei iets tot zijn stuurman deze verwijderde zich de ramen werden gesloten en het licht aan het plafond werd ontstoken
0.018519, hoe woedden wij toen tegen die monsters wij waren ons zelven geen meester meer tien twaalf inkvisschen waren op het plat tegen de zijden van den nautilus opgekropen wij sprongen tusschen al die slangen heen en weer die op het dek bloed en zwart vocht lagen te rillen het scheen dat die glibberige vo0.020000, elarmen evenals de koppen van de hydra telkens weer aangroeiden met elken stoot drong de harpoen van ned land een der oogen van een inktvisch en stiet het er uit maar plotseling werd mijn stoutmoedige makker omver geworpen door den voelarm van een der monsters dien hij niet kunnen vermijden
0.111111, "mijnheer aronnax wilt gij dat ik hem ga opzoeken"
0.040000, "mijnheer aronnax" zei kapitein nemo "ik zal u heden hetzelfde antwoord geven als voor zeven maanden hij die den nautilus komt verlaat hem niet meer"
0.090909, de kapitein keek mij aan terwijl hij de armen elkander sloeg
0.019608, door de geopende ramen van den salon zag ik groote visschen als spoken schuw voorbijsnellen enkele werden onder mijn oogen door den bliksem getroffen de nautilus daalde nog altijd ik dacht dat wij op vijftien meter diepte kalm water zouden zijn maar neen de bovenvlakte al te heftige beweging wij mo0.027778, esten de kalmte een diepte van vijftig meter opzoeken maar welk een rust welk een kalmte heerschte ook daar wie zou gezegd hebben dat op dat oogenblik een orkaan woedde aan de oppervlakte van den oceaan
0.018868, ik naar mijn kamer gegaan waar ik ned land en koenraad stilzwijgend bij elkander zag zitten ik gevoelde nu een onoverkomelijken afkeer van kapitein nemo wat hij ook van de menschen te lijden gehad toch hij geen recht om te vergelden ik mij zoo geen medeplichtige ten minste getuige van zijn wraak ge0.200000, maakt dit reeds te veel
0.090909, men begrijpt dat onder die omstandigheden onze toestand niet meer houdbaar
0.041667, "van nacht men schijnt aan boord niet meer te waken men zou zeggen dat ze allen verslagen zijn zult gij u gereed houden mijnheer"
0.050000, "in het gezicht van land dat ik van morgen door den nevel heen op twintig kilometer het oosten gezien heb"
0.034483, plotseling hoorde wij daarbinnen een rumoer luide stemmen gaven elkander antwoord wat er gebeurd men onze vlucht bemerkt ik voelde dat ned land mij een dolk de hand stopte
0.125000, "ja" mompelde ik "wij zullen weten te sterven"
